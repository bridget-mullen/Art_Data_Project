In Red White Black Nigger, Ringgold confronts the highly charged and topical subject of the role of blackness within American culture. Inspired in part by Jasper Johns’s flag paintings, Ringgold references the colors of the U.S. flag both linguistically and visually. She uses black pigment to modulate the work’s dominant red, white, and blue pigments, rather than mixing them with white as painters traditionally had done. Most pointedly, Ringgold painted the word “NIGGER” within each horizontal swath of color. This abhorrent, incendiary word evokes centuries of oppression and the violent reaction to the struggle for civil rights and the black power movement in the late 1960s. Yet against the darkened background, the word nearly disappears, a possible allusion to the white cultural erasure of African Americans and the pervasive stain of racism within the national fabric. Ringgold’s substitution of the word “black” in the third row, where one might expect the word “blue,” stops the viewer short and insists on recognition of this country’s inability to deliver on its promise of liberty for all.",American,349671,"61 × 61 cm (24 × 24 in.)
