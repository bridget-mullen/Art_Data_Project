Examples of it can be seen in almost every portrait of Mughal emperors and courtiers from the late 16th century to the 19th century. The patka was a long, narrow, textile associated with courtly dress. The patka was worn about the wearer's waist, over top a long shirt.",,"The dimensions of the patka (247.3 cm long with fringe and 46.5cm wide) are similar to many others but the pattern on the end panels is unusual. Instead of the characteristic row of tall flowering plants, there is a repeat pattern of staggered rows of a highly stylised floral sprig, with a short stem, a leaf and a flower head.

Several are known, found in Italy, particularly in the south and around ancient Taras/Tarentum (Taranto). Some are in relief, but most have the symbols impressed into the disk.

The disks often bear many of the same motifs, some arranged in similar configurations from object to object. The objects may represent divinities--some common associations like Zeus with the thunderbolt, Hephaistos with the tongs, Poseidon with the trident, Hermes with the caduceus, Apollo with the lyre, and Athena with the owl are very clear--but many are in fact everyday items that are not necessrily associated with any particular god or goddess. They may, therefore, represent a mixture of sacred and profane objects, a selection of offerings, or as Prof. McDaniel suggested in his 1924 article about these disks, items loosely associated with the city of Tarentum. Favoring the latter explanation, McDaniel suggested that the symbols formed a ""compound seal"" used in commerce, associated with Tarentum. They would have been impressed in wax or on clay to form seal impressions that would be particularly difficult to duplicate due to their complexity.",Molded,"This intact terracotta circular disk, with a rectangular pierced tang at the bottom, bears the impression of more than two dozen symbols. From top to bottom, starting with the upper register, the objects can be identified as a grape bunch over a crescent moon, tongs, two amphorae or kantharoi flanking three distaffs (for spinning) above an owl, and a four-spoked wheel; in the second register, there is a distaff with wool wound around it, a club, trident, distaff, caduceus, patera or offering bread, lighting bolt, scabbard, torch with flame arching to the right, and a ladder-shape, possibly an Apulian sistrum (a type of musical instrument). In the third register, there are three round offering cakes, a wavy symbol that could be a bow or serpent or cuttlefish above a square tablet, a lyre above an open hand, a bird (an eagle or a dove) facing right above an infinity symbol (either an open box mirror or cymbals) above a strigil or Egyptian sistrum, next to two difficult to read objects, of which one might be an oil flask.

The words ""Libre expansion...etc."" probably relate to the writings of the anarchist Jean Grave (1854-1939), whom Cross supported. The free development of the individual in society was one of Grave's concerns.

For Napoleon this novel about the limits of women's freedom in an aristocratic society was controversial enough to exile the writer.

The painting ranks as one of the more successful attempts to capture speed and movement in paint, perhaps in part because of its quick execution.  The blurred features of the dog and the vigorous scrubbing of the landscape combine to create an impression of tremendous vitality.
        
Born near Naples in 1877, Stella emigrated to New York City in 1896, where he studied with William Merritt Chase and may have been influenced by Robert Henri as well, witness his preference for contemporary urban subjects.  He encountered European modernism during a 1909-13 trip to Europe and was especially taken with a show of Fururist paintings at the Bernheim-Jeune Gallery in Paris in 1912.  On his return in 1913, he experienced the further shock of the Armory Show, and for several years painted in a Futurist style, which gradually became more hieratic and stylized by the end of the decade with his famous works based on the Brooklyn Bridge, of which the Fogg owns three drawings.  For the remainder of his career Stella vacillated wildly between styles and never recaptured the intensity of the work he did in the teens.  Dating his works is difficult, so the ""circa 1914"" is an educated guess open to revision pending further research.

Each print comprises a smattering of texts and images: some fragmentary, some fully realized, some drawn on the stone, some transferred from other sources. Prince's hand-written texts tell jokes, the kinds of raunchy, yet classic jokes allegedly told among men. The prints are an extension of his painting practice. In the late 1980s, Prince began a series of joke paintings that critics have related to the humor and cartoon imagery featured in men's magazines like Playboy. In fact, the portfolio box that contains the prints the prints is decorated with a Playboy bunny on its cover. Yet although Prince deploys such iconic signifiers of masculinity as the bunny and dirty traveling salesmen jokes, the picture of masculinity he conjures is a confusing questioning one. In fact even the Playboy bunny is manipulated-it's given a dangerous-looking set of teeth. Included among the texts are affirmations of male homosexuality, certainly a subject taboo in men's porn magazines. The print publisher Susan Inglett claims that the drawings for the prints were made after prince and his wife separated and he was engaged in a homosexual affair. Whatever his personal stake in the imagery is, the prints examine masculinity in a sensitive, smart, and unusual way.",Lithograph,,"Twelve lithographs housed in a black cloth box with embroidered ""skull bunny""",Untitled (Portfolio of Twelve Prints),Purchase,,1991,Department of Prints,1991,"[{'role': 'Artist', 'birthplace': 'Panama Canal Zone', 'gender': 'male', 'displaydate': 'born 1949', 'prefix': None, 'culture': 'American', 'displayname': 'Richard Prince', 'alphasort': 'Prince, Richard', 'name': 'Richard Prince', 'personid': 18966, 'deathplace': None, 'displayorder': 1}, {'role': 'Printer', 'birthplace': None, 'gender': 'unknown', 'displaydate': None, 'prefix': None, 'culture': 'American', 'displayname': 'Arber & Son Editions', 'alphasort': 'Arber & Son Editions', 'name': 'Arber & Son Editions', 'personid': 26422, 'deathplace': None, 'displayorder': 2}, {'role': 'Publisher', 'birthplace': None, 'gender': 'unknown', 'displaydate': None, 'prefix': None, 'culture': None, 'displayname': 'I.

The emperor Diocletian (284 - 305 CE) in 293 CE established the Tetrarchy: a new system dividing the administration of East and West, with two senior emperors, the Augusti, and two junior emperors, the Caesares.
 
When this coin was minted, Constantius Chlorus was the Augustus in the western empire and Galerius (Gaius Galerius Valerius Maximianus) was Augustus in the eastern empire. Much official imperial iconography during the Tetrarchy sought to present the emperors as united, after a century of civil war. Coins issued by one co-emperor depicting his colleague helped project an image of unity and stability. The similarity of their portraits also contributed to this message: the emperors’ images are difficult to distinguish from each other, presenting a unified image of imperial rule.
 
This is one such coin. It depicts a portrait of Galerius, identifiable from his titles listed in the inscription. It, however, was minted in Italy, in the western part of the empire, and thus was issued under the authority of his co-Augustus, Constantius Chlorus.",Struck,"Obverse: Head of Galerius, laureate, right

The tradition of using rosewater came to Mughal India from Iran, where, in the festival of Ab Pashan, rosewater was sprinkled to invoke the memory of rainfall, which would put an end to famine. The custom was gradually incorporated into the Rajput court, where it was used in both ceremonial as well as religious festivals. It is now used in India to welcome arriving guests. 

Objects such as this sprinkler were widely produced for international exhibitions, such as the Colonial and Indian Exhibition held in London in 1886.",,"The silver rosewater sprinkler has a bulbous body, a long, tapering spout with floral scrollwork, and a blooming, flower-shaped finial. The floral nozzle has five piercings from which rosewater can be sprinkled. The body, which would have contained the rosewater, is decorated with floral designs set within a medallion of leaves. 

The major centers in India for silver-work were Bombay, Calcutta, Cutch, Kashmir, Lucknow, and Madras. Stylistically, this sprinkler can be attributed to Bhuj, in Cutch (now Kutch), Gujarat. The base contains an illegible inscription which probably gives the name of the workshop where the object was created.

The custom of sprinkling guests with cool, scented rosewater originated in Iran. As vessels like this one demonstrate, the practice was adopted by elites at Hindu and Muslim courts and, later, by wealthy Europeans in India. During the 19th century, the Hindu monarchs of Kachchh promoted its silverware through diplomatic gifts and at international exhibitions in London, Paris, and the United States, where its floral patterns proved popular with consumers.",Indian,27294,26.5 x 9.8 cm (10 7/16 x 3 7/8 in.)

What the Paper Sculpture Show consists of is seventy-seven sheets of paper, by thirty artists (including two persons working together as a single ""artist""), who have each created  a sculpture that is to be cut out from one to four sheets of paper and assembled by a gallery visitor.  The sheets were intended to be taken away from the gallery, that is, the paper sculpture show could occur in three dimensions in any space anywhere; but in the several exhibition venues where the sheets were available, the sculptures were made up and could be viewed as completed works of art.  We already have a portfolio issued in 1995 in a large edition by The Sculpture Center in New York, in which sculptors make two-dimensional distillations of their sculptural aesthetic. ""The Paper Sculpture Show"" takes the process much further, and is more akin to the 1968 SMS portfolios, also in our collection, where offset photolithographic ""things"" -- some of which requiring assembly -- are bundled together, to be unpacked by the owners of the portfolios wherever they please .  Fluxus boxes, while not usually requiring any assembly on the part of their owner, also require participation, even performance.

She moved to New York City in 1935 and in the 1940s met the surrealist painter Max Ernst, whom she would marry in 1946.

Sandri himself suffered from mental illness: the lithograph is dated to the year preceding his first entrance into an insane asylum. He would be repeatedly hospitalized until his death, in the hospital, in 1937.  Sandri's intense image of the author, whose suffering from physical ills and unconsummated loves was the basis for his tragic poetry, must derive some of its affecting introspective mood from the artist's own troubled mind. 

Sandri's work has received critical attention in Italy, most recently in exhibitions in Milan (2001,S. Ambrogio Museum, ""From sufferance to faith"") and Rome (2002, Palazzo delle Esposizioni, ""Art, madness, a language of the soul""). It seems as if the emphasis was placed on his drawn portraits of fellow patients, as well as his landscapes, which seem to be greatly appreciated by critics.  In 1965, the critic L. Bracchi, on the occasion of a posthumous exhibition in Saronno, wrote, ""I recall above all his graphic work which is impressive. From a psychological point of view I especially recall the splendid drawings of the lunatics. They are real portraits carried out with a dedication worthy of Dürer. They are precise even if simple pencil drawings. We must not forget his paintings that show his love of nature which he shows simply as if through the eyes of an innocent child, which our friend Sandri was."" These sentiments are typical of later criticism as well. 

This portrait of the dead Leopardi, apparently imagined at night under a grape arbor, embodies the same synthesis of portrait draftsmanship and a sensibility toward nature. Beyond the artistic quality of the image, this is a remarkably sensitive blend of lithographic crayon and tusche, printed with exquisite delicacy on a toned sheet of laid paper.  The grain of the paper shows through the expanses of black wash, harmonizing them with the luminous features of the poet, which are realized in crayon.",Lithograph,,,Giacomo Leopardi,Not Recorded,,1923,Department of Prints,1923,"[{'role': 'Artist', 'birthplace': 'Rossignlione, Genoa, Italy', 'gender': 'unknown', 'displaydate': '1892 - 1959', 'prefix': None, 'culture': 'Italian', 'displayname': 'Gino Sandri', 'alphasort': 'Sandri, Gino', 'name': 'Gino Sandri', 'personid': 25448, 'deathplace': None, 'displayorder': 1}]",https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/49587,20th century,22.2005,,Italian,49587,stone: 40 x 30 cm (15 3/4 x 11 13/16 in.)

Gimignano in the midst of an intramural war.  The towers of the medieval city were supposed to have been constructed as acts of rivalry among its wealthy resident families, but the idea of siege engines, flaming barrages from catapults, and executed traitors seems to have been Disertori's fantasy.  Were hostilities provoked by rape, adultery, and other acts of illicit love, sparked by the planetary goddess above? 

The inscription in a somewhat garbled Latin claims, however, that Venus will bring peace:  ""[as translated into Italian in the catalogue raisonne] Salve o Venere cacciatrice di bellezza, rinata in cielo dalla stella soave per portare pace nella bella città.""  Drawings survive that show that Disertori derived the siege engines and other instruments of war from several medieval visual sources, including the Paris 1483 edition of Valturio's ""De re militari"" and manuscripts in Italian archives.

This plate, commissioned in 1855 from the Ruisdael painting ""Le Coup de Soleil"", in the collection of the Louvre since the late 18th century, was completed in 1860 and exhibited at the 1861 Salon. Although the Chalcographie published proof impressions prior to lettering the plate for the regular edition, this impression does not bear the Chalcographie seal. It is evidently one of the dozen or so preliminary proofs pulled by Delâtre, which according to Michel Melot, cataloguer of Daubigny's prints, were much more desirable than the Chalcographie proofs. Even earlier proofs, complete with the artist's signature, as here, were also pulled, some prior to extensive cross-hatching. 

This impression is in perfect condition, which derives from an important French 19th-century collection, that of Alfred Lebrun, a banker and serious print amateur, who was the first cataloguer of the printed oeuvre of Millet.

Gallagher employs much the same imagery in her paintings as well, confessing that for the painting ""Falls and Flips,"" for example, she isolated advertisements of synthetic-fiber African-American wigs, and that more generally, ""I scan pages from advertisements about control: acne, unruly hair, corns, bunions, and asthma"" (""Ellen Gallagher Talks about 'Pomp-Bang,' 2003,"" 'Artforum, April 2004, p. 128).

The Romans borrowed from the Hellenistic tradition of casting glass vessels. This technique was time-consuming and produced glass vessels with very thick walls, requiring much raw material. In the first century BCE, the Romans developed the method of glass-blowing, which revolutionized the industry. Glass could then be manufactured on a larger scale, and as a result, it was no longer a rare material.

This skyphos, a cup with horizontal handles, was made in a period when Greek vases bore mostly geometric motifs. The raised and painted tongues imitate the lobes of metal vessels such as the phiale (1979.357) on the right. 
",Wheel-made,"Very low ring base. Squat, echinoid body with shallow lobing along surface. Loop handles set at a slight angle above the horizontal, placed just below join between body and shoulder. Very narrow shoulder curves up to a low, vertical, collar-like rim.

Orange-buff fabric with dark brown slip. Slip flaking on exterior. From a solid ground line that extends up from the base, tongues, outlined in double and filled with a row of chevrons, arise. Just below the shoulder, a dot rosette fills the blank space between each of these tongues. The shoulder and rim contain a row of dots flanked by two solid lines. Hatch marks decorate the handles. The interior of the vessel is completely slipped with a brown slip slightly darker than that found on most of the vessel's exterior. Small patches of irridescence are visible here.

The undulating surface of this vessel and its chevroned-tongue decoration are likely meant to represent the gadrooning (lobing) seen on metal vessels (see Coldstream 1968, 50-51).

This work takes account of the format: whatever might be the representational or symbolic intent of the object (that is, the drawing) when removed from its envelope, unfolded, and stood on its flat side, when the envelope package is assembled with the folded object inside in its the most engaging orientation, the object peers out like a startled voyeur. The envelope, with object, was addressed by Fine to Dadaland, which (or who) lived at 1117 Geary Street, #21, in San Francisco in March 1972. This was probably Bill Gaglione, an acolyte in New York of Ray Johnson, the mail art pioneer. Gaglione may well have met Fine there, but he moved to San Francisco and began his own mail art nexus there, along with instigating many other disruptive events and practices in Dada/Fluxus mode. Perhaps the most notable was The Pink Dot Caper, in which Gaglione and like-minded friends peppered the city with Avery self-adhesive dots.  Another venture was the ""Bay Area Weekly Breeder,"" co-edited by Gaglione, a zine satire on both ""The Weekly Reader,"" a public school magazine, and Ray Johnson's ""New York Correspondence School,"" an entirely irrational and irreverent Fluxus publication. It should be noted that the trimming of the object isolates on its verso the single word ""FLASH"" (white on black, surrounded by radiating lines). Presumably the matrix from which this word was cut would be found in an issue of ""Bay Area Weekly Breeder"" or ""New York Correspondence School.""",,"A piece of paper was cut from the page of a publication, isolating the word FLASH (white on black with lines radiating around it), and cut into the shape of a flaming, irregularly seven-pointed star standing on a broad base. The front was spray-painted with black, using a large washer or some such perforated disk as a stencil after the sheet was somewhat gray, so that the end effect is of a gray iris with a black pupil centering the black star-like form.  This was then folded vertically, eye/star side out, and inserted into an envelope with a glassine window, so that half of the eye/star peers out. This original orientation is only presumed, since the envelope was opened by its recipient, and the object inside must have been removed and reinserted many times.","Paper, glassine",Untitled (addressed to Dadaland),Purchase,"[Steven Lieber, San Francisco] sold; to Harvard Art Museums, 2004",1972,Department of Drawings,1972,"[{'role': 'Artist', 'birthplace': 'Boston', 'gender': 'unknown', 'displaydate': '1931 - 1987', 'prefix': None, 'culture': 'American', 'displayname': 'Albert M.

According to the Project Description provided by Dieu Donné, ""The Cut Stems"" ""was based on a sample found in the artist's 19th century album of seaweed specimens. The image was translated into a watermark using fabric paint on no-see-um mosquito netting. In the studio, a base sheet of unpigmented, translucent abaca [Manila hemp] paper was formed and couched (transferred) onto a pellon. Next, the no-see-um netting was placed on top of the papermaking mould and a pigmented, blue-gray sheet of translucent abaca was pulled. The elevated, painted areas of the watermark created thinner areas in the colored sheet. This sheet was then couched directly on top of the base sheet, illuminating the image. Finally, the sheets were pressed in a hydraulic press and dried in a forced-air drying system.""",,,"Laminated, pigmented abaca with watermark",The Cut Stems,Gift,"[Dieu Donné Papermill, Inc., New York], sold; to Edward Saywell, Boston, Massachusetts; gift; to Harvard University Art Museums, 2008",2003,Department of Drawings,2003,"[{'role': 'Artist', 'birthplace': 'Los Angeles', 'gender': 'male', 'displaydate': '1951 - 2020', 'prefix': None, 'culture': 'American', 'displayname': 'James Brown', 'alphasort': 'Brown, James', 'name': 'James Brown', 'personid': 24056, 'deathplace': 'Valladolid, Mexico', 'displayorder': 1}]",https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/70415,21st century,2008.46,,American,70415,38.9 x 27.1 cm (15 5/16 x 10 11/16 in.)

And this particular postcard has been cited as the epitome of Fluxus by Craig Saper in his essay ""Fluxus as a Laboratory"" ('The Fluxus Reader,' Ken Friedman, ed., p. 136), following this description of the characteristic Fluxus work of art: ""Fluxus often parodied the kind of art that posits a masterpiece appreciated by a spectator.  By contrast, Fluxus works highlighted social-poetic interaction and encouraged epistemological experimentation among participant-users."" The movement's latter-day propensity for very long words should not overwhelm the brief, Zen-like formulation of the postcard, again, entirely characteristic of Fluxus and mail art, especially as practiced in the slightly later, West-Coast mode, as here.  It is interesting to note that in an interview with Friedman conducted some time in the 1970s, the artist prophesized the internet, at least as his desire, as a qualitative leap beyond mail art. The interviewer, George M. Gugelberger, had said, ""A large part of your achievement is correspondence.  You seem to consider yourself as a large correspondence center.""  Friedman replied, ""Yes. Truly I am waiting for an information system that would make it possible for us to enter into a telephone booth and be put in contact with everything essential.""

Dancers inside each of the larger lobes strike different poses and hold different objects; most appear to be female with clearly visible breasts, round hips, and hair tied up. The lowest dancer holds a pair of upside-down thyrsi staffs, suggesting these are Dionysiac maenads. Another may hold wineskins and others vine garlands or scarves. The uppermost dancer might hold a pair of instruments (sistra?). Inside smaller vine lobes are unidentifiable mammals. Each smaller lobe sprouts two grape leaves. 
A reverse scallop border runs outside the band on each side, with small leaves or fruit baskets sitting in the curvatures. The point of each scallop is flared. Compare this border to that on Harvard’s 1931.35.6.

""Dancers, Nude Study"" is on tracing paper and apparently originated as a tracing from a pastel in a private collection (Lemoisne 1352), which showed the dancers in costume. Degas took a counterproof of our drawing (Lemoisne 1355bis), and he also traced it to make another version with only slight alterations (Lemoisne 1357).  These three (Lemoisne 1352, 1355bis, and 1357) are the most closely related works, but the group of variants is more extensive (see George T.

The cross, often decorated with jewels, and paired with birds and flowers is a popular theme in Early Byzantine art from Egypt and especially in textiles and garments. The birds and flowers communicate the idea of Christ as a source of new life. The cross was a protective symbol and found throughout the home and on clothing as well as in more formal religious settings. 

The layout of the decoration may suggest this textile originally served a function as a shawl or a furnishing textile like a pillow cover.","Woven, tapestry weave","This textile fragment includes a tapestry woven square and two tapestry woven bands that meet at a right angle. These bands may have once run around the inner square to form a continuous framing border. Between the areas of tapestry weave is an area of plain undyed ground weave. Some of the plain ground also survives on the right side of the tapestry square and above the upper band. Vertical slits on the sides of the square and the vertical band have been stitched closed in buff and red threads. The tabby weave contains several decorative self-bands of undyed wefts. Supplementary buff wefts wrap around some of the warps to create the straight vertical lines needed in the design. The warps run parallel to the design. 

The tapestry square is further subdivided into square and rectangular segments each containing a bird or a red abstract shape. The center compartment contains a bright yellow jeweled cross against a light blue medallion at its center. Individual pink round gems are positioned between the arms of the cross. The border of the medallion is formed from a circular vine; tendrils with leaves sprout from this vine and fill the empty corners of the square holding the medallion. Two of these tendrils survive; one is dark blue and the other red. At the four corners of the tabula are dark blue squares containing duck-like birds with red beaks and wings against a buff circle. These stand in profile and are mirror-symmetrical around the cross. The other four segments of the tapestry square are dark blue rectangles holding coiling red abstract shapes.  Inside the corners of all of compartments are buff dots. 

The same birds (inside squares) and curving red shapes (inside rectangles) also form the two bands that meet at a right angle. At the corner where the bands meet, the red shape has three coils instead of two. A red, eight-petalled flower against a buff circle is also used in this border.

A sawtooth border of dark blue and buff triangles surrounds the square and bands.

In the lower portion of the band, three such squares are grouped together one above the next and the group surrounded by a light colored band. The middle of these three compartments is red and features a male rider atop a pink prancing horse. The horse’s raised front leg is blue and stands out from the rest of the animal. Above and below this rider are teal colored squares filled with stylized, stalky plants with spade-shaped leaves. Above these plants grounding out of the groundline are two yellow free-floating shapes, possibly also meant as plant forms. 

Above this group of three squares is a single square containing a vine medallion; tendrils with leaves sprout from this vine and fill the empty corners of the square holding the medallion. Within this medallion is a nude female nereid riding upon a sea monster. She throws her hands up in a posture often seen among Dionysiac dancers and meant to indicate revelry.

At the top of the band, the pattern of several squares grouped together appears again. The first square has the same design of foliage as does the lowest square at the bottom of the band. Above it is a red square with a partial motif of an orange animal. Another square of foliage probably once existed above this. 

On either side of the band, some fabric survives that hints at the appearance of the rest of the textile from which this fragment has been cut. A brown wave scroll border outlined in white is visible on both sides of the red band. Plain undyed fabric exists outside the wave border.

His work depicts the African-American experience, as is apparent in this screenprint of migrant workers casting their votes in an election from the 1920s. Much of his work demonstrates his commitment to African Americans achieving racial equality, and he is best know for series on figures such as Frederick Douglas and Harriet Tubman. In 1940-41, Lawrence executed a series of 60 paintings entitled ""The Migration of the Negro,"" from which this print is thematically derived. After the first world war, millions of blacks left the south and moved to northern cities, where they experienced the freedom to vote for the first time. This screenprint is a complex layering of multiple colors and comes from the portfolio, the Kent Bicentennial Portfolio, commissioned by Lorillard, a division of Loews Theaters, Inc.

This impression exemplifies his experimentation well. Its somewhat trite subject -- a standing putto copied from a Guido Reni drawing -- is merely the vehicle for experimentation in technique, medium, and support. Denon has used etching and roulette, conventional enough for the 18th century, but he extended the tonal potential of roulette to create vapous veils of pale tone, perhaps by the direct application of acid to the plate. For this impression he selected an astonishing shade of blue ink, suggestive of Prussian blue, a synthetic pigment invented only a few decades earlier which had come into great fashion but which is as far as possible from the gray or brown washes that would have characterized the Reni original. Finally, as a further distinction to this impression, Denon selected a soft grayish-white Chinese paper.

The tablet is whole and inscribed on both surfaces. The envelope is partially destroyed, but preserves multiple impressions of the same seal. The tablet and envelope probably come from the trading colony (karum) by the mound of Kültepe (ancient Kanesh) near Kaiseri in Cappadocia (central Anatolia), from the period karum-Kanesh level II (c. 1927-1836 B.C.E).

The text is a letter (25 lines) between two copper traders, in which a certain Aššur-lamassi, from an unknown place in central Anatolia, informs a Šu-Belum in Kanesh that he is sending him silver as proceeds of his copper (7 talents, 30 minas), carried by an Iddi(n)-Su'en. Later on, silver for an additional 20 minas of copper will be added. The price for copper is 1 shekel of silver for 62 ½ shekels of copper. All the traders mentioned in this text are also noted in the archive of the well known copper trader Adad-S,ululi, son of Kuskusum/Šu-Anum, excavated in 1948 in the karum area of Kultepe (cf. J.G. Dercksen, The Old Assyrian Copper Trade in Anatolia. PIHANS 75. Leiden 1996, pp. 93-107). On the envelope, which is partially destroyed, the seal of the sender, Aššur-lamassi, is impressed eight times.

A piriform unguentarium is distinguished by its pear-shaped base. 

Unguentaria were among the earliest shapes made in blown glass and the piriform shaped (pear-shape) unguentarium were common in clear, pale blue-green glass (1). The bulbous form of the unguentarium was originally made in colored glass, but by the first century CE the pale, blue-green glass seen here predominated. In later forms, the bottom flattens and the neck becomes longer.

Cortesi",2001-12-15T00:00:00-05:00,Modern and Contemporary Art,,77,2002.0,Paintings,,,"""To_______( Shelley)"" reads almost as a painting within a painting, a large square of deep purple paint, scraped with a palette knife in visible, discreet strokes is surrounded by a broad, painted ""frame"" constructed of varying rectangular and square shapes in varied shades of brown-to-charcoal black oil, again applied with a palette knife, but in much broader swathes. These painted rectangles stop short of the four corners, which are painted very thinly in a blacker black. The border has passages reminiscent of Rothko's stacked and blurred quadrilaterals, while the painting on the central square is far too textured to sustain the sense of dematerialization so essential to Rothko's surfaces. Ohlson maintains a taut push-pull balance between the contained and containing areas of paint, undercutting any sense of illusionism that a ""frame"" might suggest.

While Ohlson is by no means a key figure within late 60's painting, his studied, incremental development of a reductive, affective, colorist painting conflated a keen understanding of the late Abstract Expressionist painting of Franz Kline, Clyfford Still and Mark Rothko with a more constructive, minimalist-inspired and serial approach. Over the past 50 years, Ohlson has produced an impressive succession of paintings, at once expressive and cerebral. ""to_______."" is a dark and moody painting that animates its self-consciously constructed composition and carefully counterpointed surface textures  with subtle, but highly affective color. Goosen refers to Ohlson's daily work on the farm in Iowa where he was born and raised in the Depression-era Thirties as possible source for his colors. He describes the skies Ohlson would have seen each day as metamorphosing from yellowish pink and green at noon to ""red-orange sunsets that swiftly slide from purple to black."" The deep purple and velvet blacks of ""To_______(Shelley)"" would seem to owe something to those skies: the colors are too idiosyncratic and implausible to suggest anything more cerebral.",,"Painting is oil on primed canvas, with unpainted edges and a thinly painted black surface, over which the artist has applied a slightly thicker layer of paint with a palette knife. The composition comprises a square of deep purple surrounded by various oblong/rectangular/squarish shapes in a subtly calibrated range of charcoal/brown blacks that read as a frame for this interior square.",Oil on canvas,To _________ (Shelley),Gift,"[Susan Caldwell Gallery, New York, New York], sold; to Henry B.

In East Germany, he had developed his signature style and artistic vocabulary, built around a repertoire of stick figures, a schematic sign language, and primitivising execution. Closely echoing the language of Paul Klee's late work, these means were deployed by Penck to explore themes of social systems, communication, and human interaction. The present work shows how Penck was able to continue these concerns (though without significant development, which lead to a certain routine in his production): the ""romantic dispute"" of the title is carried out by two rearing beasts, one (male?) spotted like a leopard and marked with ""z z"", the other (female?) in blue with ""x x"" markings.

Now he is more famous for his whimsical compositions, uniquely wiped with colored inks and printed on exotic papers. This composition is indeed whimsical, but the content, the triumph of etching over engraving, is a distinctly late-19th-century theme that has little resonance today.

In 1877 Buhot and ""L'Illustration nouvelle"" were celebrating the artistic dominance of the Etching Revival, which had relegated all other graphic processes to the limbo of commercialism. By this date, both metal and wood engraving were not ""original"" print processes, and woodcut and lithography had yet to be revived as artistic means of expression, as they would be in the 1890, when etching came to seem too fluent a medium. Nine years earlier, however, in 1868, it commissioned its frontispiece from Félix Bracquemond, another leading artist of the French Etching Revival. 

This composition was selected by Frederick Keppel, the leading American dealer in etchings in the late 19th century, for a presentation before The Union Club of New York in 1890 or 1891.","Etching, drypoint and aquatint",,Etching and drypoint with roulette and aquatint on off-white laid paper,The Funeral of the Burin (Frontispiece),Not Recorded,,1877,Department of Prints,1877,"[{'role': 'Artist', 'birthplace': 'Valognes (Manche), France', 'gender': 'male', 'displaydate': '1847 - 1898', 'prefix': None, 'culture': 'French', 'displayname': 'Félix Hilaire Buhot', 'alphasort': 'Buhot, Félix Hilaire', 'name': 'Félix Hilaire Buhot', 'personid': 31436, 'deathplace': 'Paris', 'displayorder': 1}]",https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/165406,19th century,7.2007,,French,165406,"plate: 34.6 × 27.5 cm (13 5/8 × 10 13/16 in.)

Bowl with Horse and Cheetah
Iran, Nishapur, Samanid dynasty, 10th century
Earthenware with black, green, and yellow under glaze
Arthur M. Sackler Museum, The Norma Jean Calderwood Collection of Islamic Art, 2002.50.68

In the so-called buff wares made by Samanid-period potters, the buff background of the design is some¬times a colored slip and sometimes, as here, simply the color of the earthenware body itself. The boldly painted design on the interior of this small bowl fea¬tures a collared feline on the back of a wide-eyed horse. The vignette should probably be understood as a shorthand reference to the prestigious and ancient sport of hunting with trained cheetahs. Relying on short bursts of extraordinary speed to seize the prey quickly, cheetahs were usually set on gazelles, rab¬bits, and other fleet game. Because they were low in stamina, cheetahs had to be conveyed to the hunt. One of the trainer’s more demanding tasks was to teach his charge to ride pillion on the back of a horse.
","Underglazed, painted","Figural designs on polychrome ceramics offer tantalizing and often puzzling glimpses into the complex society of the Samanid realm, now divided between northeastern Iran and Uzbekistan.The majority of these wares are made of buff-colored earthenware decorated with lively, and often freely rendered, figural images painted in bright colors under clear glaze. The decoration of this small bowl has been executed with exceptional detail and care. Fluid and confident strokes of black slip delineate a crested bird, a spotted feline, and a well-groomed horse. These forms are filled or dotted with green and yellow. The feline and the horse raise their right forelegs; they both sport ankle bands and scalloped collars. The horse has a cropped mane, a knotted tail, and curling fetlocks. Filling its body is a bold pseudo-inscription in floriated and spiraling Kufic script. The top of its eye is defined by two extended parallel lines; this distinctive treatment is occasionally found in figural wares excavated in Nishapur. The feline may be identified as a cheetah by the black stripe descending from its eye.
The vignette of a collared feline on the back of an imposing horse may be a shorthand reference to the costly, prestigious, and ancient sport of hunting with cheetahs. Capable of short bursts of extraordinary speed, cheetahs were usually set on gazelles, rabbits, and other fleet game, but because stamina was not one of their virtues, they had to be conveyed to the hunt. One of the cheetah trainer’s more demanding tasks was to teach his charge to ride pillion on the back of a horse moving at any speed.
The exterior decoration of this bowl consists of pendant leaf shapes painted in an alternating pattern: a buff leaf with an interior dot-dash-dot device alternates with a colored leaf, sequentially yellow or green. No slip is detectable over the light buff ceramic body. The entire bowl, including the flat, slightly concave base, is covered in a clear glaze. The bowl has been reassembled from at least three large fragments and has minor losses and repairs along the rim.","Buff-colored earthenware painted with black (manganese and iron), yellow (lead-tin), and green (copper) under clear lead glaze",Bowl with a Cheetah Standing on the Back of a Horse,Gift,"[Hadji Baba Rabbi House of Antiquities, Teheran, before 1973], sold; to Stanford and Norma Jean Calderwood, Belmont, MA (by 1973-2002), gift; to Harvard Art Museums, 2002.",10th century,Department of Islamic & Later Indian Art,0,,https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/165419,10th century,2002.50.68,"Following the Prophet Muhammad’s example, the Islamic polity, or caliphate, was ruled by a political and religious leader titled the caliph, or “successor” to the Prophet.

Bowl with Rooster Holding a Fish
Iraq, Basra, `Abbasid dynasty, late 9th–early 10th century
Earthenware with luster painted over glaze 
Arthur M. Sackler Museum, The Norma Jean Calderwood Collection of Islamic Art, 2002.50.72

One of the most significant innovations attributed to ninth-century potters working in Basra was the application of luster painting to ceramics. In this failure-prone technique, the artist painted a mixture of metal oxides onto an already fired and glazed surface. The vessel was then fired a second time in a kiln with a low-oxygen atmosphere. If all went right, the design was deposited on the glaze as an irides¬cent stain, imperceptible to the touch. Probably the costliest product of the Basra kilns, lusterware was widely exported and imitated. Knowledge of the luster technique gradually spread both eastward into Iran and westward as far as Spain.
",Lusterware,"Repaired from about twenty fragments, but with only small losses, this bowl is decorated with two startled-looking animals— a rooster, and, in its beak, a fish. Their wide-eyed energy is sustained by other sharply angled elements of the design: fins and tail feathers, coxcomb, and fluttering scarf. These creatures have long carried positive associations: the rooster, as the harbinger of dawn, symbolizes hope, while the fish suggests bounty. In religious contexts, the rooster also developed more specifically auspicious connotations: according to a popular epigram attributed to the Prophet Muhammad, he crows when he sees an angel; in Christian tradition, his invigorating sound recalls the faltering to their faith.

Large Bowl with Hadith Inscriptions in Black and Red

Earthenware with slip-painting under glaze
Inscribed (Arabic) in black slip Modesty is a branch of faith, and faith is in paradise; in redslip Greed is a sign of poverty. Peace.
Arthur M. Sackler Museum, The Norma Jean Calderwood Collection of Islamic Art, 2002.50.88

In the reign of the Samanids (819–999), potters obtained a white ground by covering earthenware vessels with white slip (colored clay particles in solution). They then painted designs with different-colored slips and fired the whole under a transparent lead glaze. Among their finest works are the so-called epigraphic wares, which usually reproduce in angular Arabic script a range of benedictory phrases and popular proverbs. More rarely, as here, the vessels record examples of Hadith, that is, sayings attributed to the Prophet Muhammad and his companions. Beginning in his own lifetime, Muhammad’s conduct was considered an important guide. This bowl bears two Hadith inscriptions: in black slip, a saying attributed to Muhammad; in red slip, an epigram attributed to `Ali ibn Abi Talib, son-in-law of the Prophet and Islam’s fourth orthodox caliph.
","Underglazed, painted","With its pure white slip, precise calligraphy, and perfectly clear glaze, this deep-walled bowl embodies the finest qualities of Samanid epigraphic wares. Most surviving examples of this class of ceramics reproduce benedictory phrases or popular proverbs. More rarely, as here they record sayings attributed to the Prophet Muhammad and his Companions. Beginning in his own lifetime, Muhammad’s example was considered an important guide for how people should conduct their lives. In the early centuries of the Islamic era, sayings attributed to and anecdotes about him were collected and analyzed by numerous authors. The large andcomplex body of literature that resulted from this immense effort is known as hadith. The outer inscription on this bowl is written in black slip and records a saying attributed to the Prophet: “Modesty is a branch of faith, and faith is in paradise”.  The inner inscription, in red slip, contains a similar dictum credited to 'Ali ibn Abi Talib, Muhammad’s son-in-law and the fourth orthodox Caliph of Islam: “Greed is a sign of poverty”. Because each inscription is written in a ring, the calligrapher inserted a single-word invocation to mark the beginning: in the outer circle, “felicity”, and in the inner one, “health”. This bowl has been reassembled from about fifteen fragments, with only minimal losses. The white slip and clear glaze completely cover the vessel, including its flat, slightly concave base.",Reddish earthenware covered in white slip and painted with black (manganese and iron) and red (iron) under clear lead glaze,Bowl Inscribed with Sayings of the Prophet Muhammad and 'Ali ibn Abi Talib,Gift,"[Mansour Gallery, London, before 1973], sold; to Stanford and Norma Jean Calderwood, Belmont, MA (by 1973-2002), gift; to Harvard Art Museums, 2002.",10th century,Department of Islamic & Later Indian Art,0,,https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/165498,10th century,2002.50.88,"Following the Prophet Muhammad’s example, the Islamic polity, or caliphate, was ruled by a political and religious leader titled the caliph, or “successor” to the Prophet.

The so-called phlyax vessels, produced in greatest numbers in the workshops of Apulia and Paestum, are widely thought to show scenes either from a form of South Italian comedic drama parodying the heroes and themes of Attic tragedy, or from the re-performance of Attic comedy in South Italy (see Cambitoglu and Trendall 1978. See also S. Douglas Olson, Broken Laughter, Oxford University Press, 2007, p. 14ff). The actors, known as phlyakes, are depicted in masks and padded suits, and often sport exaggerated phalluses. Their appearance on these vases, along with components of stage buildings and sets, gives some insight into ancient Greek theater production. The McDaniel Painter, an otherwise anonymous Apulian vase painter, derives his name from this krater's attribution to him. His work is characterized by the thin laurel leaves below the rim of the vessel and the small meander pattern at the ground line of the scene.


Andreya Mihaloew, 2008",Red-figure,"Pinkish-buff fabric with glossy black slip, misfired below handles, in the area between the two youths on the B-side of the vase, and within the doorway of the A-side scene.  Added white and yellow in a good state of preservation.  Low, thick, circular base tapers upward very slightly to a reserve band, and is flat on top.  Narrow foot curves tightly outward to form a broad bell, with broad lip.  Horizontal loop handles turn slightly upward and inward at ends and project as far as the lip of the vessel.  A laurel band runs just beneath the lip.  Beneath A- and B-side scenes is a meander border broken periodically by an X-shape within a square.  The vase is in very good condition, unbroken with only minor cracks on the interior surface, and minor chipping, particularly around the lip.  

On the obverse is a simple stage (Type I, Trendall, Phlyax) without supporting columns.  A phlyax stands on the left with a Doric column behind him.  He wears padded tights and jacket and a black bordered cloak.  Concealed within the folds of the cloak are yellow and white objects.  He wears a headband and his hair and beard are white (Type L, Phlyax).  In his right hand he holds a crooked staff.

To the far right is a double door through which has just come an old woman, who advances towards the phlyax with outstretched arms.  She wears a long-sleeved peplos with a thick black border.  She has short white hair and a straight nose, and her mouth is open (Type R, Phlyax).  Hanging above and between the two figures is a comic mask with a good head of hair, short beard, and open mouth (Type B, Phlyax).

On the reverse, two youths stand facing each other.  The one to the left holds a staff in his right hand; his right shoulder is bare.  The youth to the right has both arms concealed in his himation.  Between them hang a pair of weights, symbol of the palaestra.

This is the name-piece of the McDaniel Painter.  Particularly characteristic of this artist are the thin laurel leaves around the rim and the relatively small meander.

This connection is underscored by the donors’ decision to dedicate the painting to Fried. Marioni self-consciously responds to the painting of a number of artists in our collections, especially to Pollock; Rothko; Noland; Louis; Stella and Marden; even more specifically to Robert Ryman. During the 1980’s, Marioni also instigated a series of dialogues and exhibition projects with the German painter Gunter Umberg, around the European concept of ""concrete"" painting. Like Ryman, who, in his mostly white paintings, has extracted seemingly unlimited outcomes by varying the organization and manner of his strokes; the type and density of his pigments, and the nature of his support surface and attachments of support to wall, Marioni has adapted a Minimalist reliance on permutations of a set of pre-determined variables, in his case, sticking to monochrome acrylic on canvas, but introducing a broad range of color. Marioni, however, paints with a roller, eliminating the constructive element of the stroke. In this, his project is at once more phenomenological, more iconic, and more anthropomorphic than his Abstract Expressionist or Minimalist predecessors. Marioni’s preference for an unmediated application of paint echoes Pollock, but toward different ends: he is interested in allowing the paint ""to be what it naturally is, liquid color,"" and he aims to avoid any intimation of drawing. At the same time, his layered pigments incorporate stain, but are not about staining; he relishes the corporeal association of paint with skin. Marioni has referred repeatedly to his Catholic interest in the fundamentally iconic essence of painting, citing both Veronica’s veil – the painting as relic – and Malevich as inspiration, toward this end. His paintings alternate between square, or iconic, formats and more vertical, larger scale planes. In both cases, Marioni treats the entire painting as image and works to inspire a private dialogue between the painting and its viewer.

(Linda Norden)",,"The painting is a large, vertical plane of deep mahogany red-brown acrylic, painted in two distinct layers of thick and thinly applied acrylic, beginning with a stain of dark, ""Benzimidazo"" brown, which acts as a primer. Its outer surface of ""Azoic plum brown"" appears tactile and shiny, almost sticky. The layers vary visibly in tonality and density and the plum brown surface begins to gather into extended drips that coalesce in a series of parallel rivulets about halfway down the picture plane; towards the bottom center, it pools into a series of more marked gullies and ridges, pulling apart like a painterly fjord, and lifting, like a skirt, to reveal the stain below. The acrylic also shrinks in along some of the edges, gaining thickness as it does so, and these effects, along with the implied flow of the medium , the ""breathing room"" between the layers, and its orientation and scale, serve to give the painting an anthropomorphic, object quality. The painting entreats one to interact with it as a whole object/image, and not as a picture of assorted forms or things or parts; it also gains considerably when viewed in daylight. The title, ""Red Painting 1999 No. 4"", 1999, refers to the fact that this is the fourthpainting executed by Marioni in 1999.

It is the only impression of this quintessentially Impressionist composition that was taken before the artist reworked the plate heavily, ruining the sense of light, air, and distance that is so magically captured here.  Further, this was the impression -- and not one from the reworked plate -- that the artist selected to hang with others of his prints, paintings, and drawings, in the 1880 exhibition of works by the Société Anonyme des Artistes, Peintres, Sculpteurs, Graveurs, Etc., that is, the Fifth Impressionist Exhibition.  Several of the more famous Impressionist artists had already forsaken the organization, including Monet and Cezanne, but Gauguin, Degas, and Cassatt remained; and the last three exhibited a number of prints, which, with the Pissarros', must have been a feature of the exhibition. Given their printmaking history -- they formed a virtual collective of etchers -- perhaps the selection of this print, to join the others, was a group choice.

It should be noted that although the print bears the inscription ""Paysage à l'hermitage"", the title of the print as given in the 5th Impressionist exhibition catalogue, under #141, is ""Côteaux de l'Hermitage, Pontoise"" (""Hillsides at l'Hermitage, Pontoise"").

In addition, the impression comes from the collection of Marcel Guérin (1873-1948).  Although he was too young to have appreciated the print in its earliest manifestation, he became a major scholar of Impressionism, with a specialty in the prints of Forain, Gauguin, and Degas.",Drypoint,,,"Landscape at l'Hermitage, Pointoise",Not Recorded,"Marcel Louis Guérin,  (L. 1872a), Collector.

In her work, In the course of her decade-long exploration of the ellipse and its rhythmic, graphic, and spatial qualities, Niederer experimented with a number of techniques and materials including embossed aluminum, silkscreen on glass, and incised metal tubing. Concurrently, she elaborated her ideas on paper in a number of serial works. The ink on paper drawings that comprise the Fing-W and Ro-Ko series are gestural in contradistinction to her sculptural pieces. The repetitive inscription of ellipses bound by squares forms irregular grids. Though minimal the pieces are also intimate, ink markings on small sheets of mulberry or parchment paper.

With a background in the study of Romance languages and art history, Susanna Niederer has edited for publishing houses and directed films on contemporary art. She lives and works in Zürich and Paris, though she has, in the past 20 years, held residences in such countries as Britain, Mexico, and the U.S. The Museum Wiesbaden mounted an extensive exhibit of her work with ellipses in 1999.",,,White ink on gray wove paper,Fing-W,Gift,"Margarete Roeder Gallery, New York, NY, sale, 2.

Church, Worthington Whittredge and Martin Johnson Heade--to be one of the most important artists of the Hudson River School’s second generation. Gifford’s atmospheric landscapes can be distinguished from the work of his peers by his use of glowing color to suggest a veil of light placed over the scene. The Harvard Art Museum has in its collection one of the greatest of Gifford’s European landscapes, ""Leander’s Tower on the Bosphorus,"" 1876 (1895.716).

The sketchbooks contain scenes from intermittent periods, ranging from the mid-1840s to 1874. The small book from the mid-1840s (just after Gifford’s education at Brown University from 1842-44) reflects his focus at that time on figurative studies. Those of the early 1850s depict his trips through Pennsylvania and New York, while several others date from the early 1860s, as Gifford was exploring the Hudson River landscape and northern New England. Two of the latter group contain several sketches of Gifford’s fellow artist Whittredge. An 1856-57 sketchbook documents part of Gifford’s travels in Italy, and includes sketches of Bierstadt, traveling with Gifford in Capri. In an 1861 sketchbook, Gifford--one of the few artists of his generation to serve during the Civil War--sketched portraits of his fellow soldiers in the Seventh Regiment of the New York State National Guard. Finally, the 1874 sketchbook dates from Gifford’s trip out to the West Coast.

He moved to New York after a visit there in 1985. His experience of the Swiss tradition of geometric abstraction coupled with his exposure in New York to works of Minimal Art, Radical Painting, and Concrete Art (by artists like Agnes Martin, Robert Ryman, Ad Reinhardt, and Brice Marden) led him to paint increasingly abstract pictures about color, light, and space. He has produced ultramarine paintings since around 1992 with the goal of achieving pictorial depth by only painterly means. Since there is no single focal point, viewers must adjust their own physical position(s) of viewing according to their perception of the picture. In the artist's own words, with ""this lively act of perception, the work becomes a picture-space."" Moreover, the square format manages to refer both to the material world, its dimensions determined by the artist's own body, and to the more Platonic tradition harking back to Malevich.",,"The canvas has several layers of white gesso, each of which is sanded to achieve a smooth ground. The artist applies the gesso ground around the outer edges of the stretcher, so that the painted surface appears to be floating on a smooth white porcelain block. He applies color in thin layers of glaze, like so many veils. As many as 40 layers of glaze are built up over a period of several weeks. Laying down even, continuous brushstrokes in alternating layers of vertical and horizontal orientations, he creates a subtle grid pattern. The artist often applies one or more colors in addition to blue -- in this case, 6-8 layers of cinnabar green at different depths (traces of which can be seen around the edges of the painting). Layers of ultramarine in combination with royal blue (a mixture of ultramarine and titanium white) make the other colors vibrate, acting ""as a catalyst to bring the involved colors into spacious movement on the top of the surface."" (See artist's statement in object file.) The surface texture is purely the result of brushwork, which creates a structural discipline that interacts with the expansive dematerialized sensuality of blue.

Copper and iron metal oxides were added to the glaze to impart the green and brown colors reminiscent of bronzes with different patinas; they were thus especially useful for glazing ceramic wares that imitated more expensive bronze ritual vessels. The decorative elements on these objects—mystical mountains with swirling clouds, mythical beasts, immortal figures, and bear-form supports—are associated with cosmological realms of immortals and closely replicate the relief ornamentation on sumptuous Han bronzes.

His association with the Vienna Camera Club from 1894 led him to discover pictorialist photographers such as Robert Demachy in France, and the Linked Ring group in London, and eventually Alfred Stieglitz in the USA, whom Kühn met in 1904, and who showed Kühn’s work in his Photo-Secession gallery and published it in Camera Work.

Through the work of Demachy, Kühn discovered the gum bichromate printing process which he began to use with great frequency from 1895, albeit not exclusively. Kühn experimented with different printing techniques, writing several articles on non-silver techniques. He also made photogravure prints, as exemplified in this acquisition, which he described as a ""beautiful and valuable artistic means of expression, especially suitable for those who love precise and laborious work, to achieve the fine details of photographic representation in small formats"" (Kühn, Heinrich, ""Zur photographischen Technik"" in: Enzyklopädie der Photographie und Kinematographie, Vol. 19, Halle, 1926). The tonalist aesthetic in this work recalls Impressionism’s atmospheric effects and subject matter while it also points towards abstraction. Kühn was known to subtitle his pictures ""Study in values"" or ""Study in tones"" (according to Michel Frizot in The New History of Photography, Cologne, 1998). The rich tonal qualities of the prints were sometimes enhanced by a dramatic point of view, such as the point of view from above in this picture.

Pressed in the shape of a traditional Easter chocolate bunny, the material of rabbit excrement belies and reverses its cute attractiveness to viewers. 
Commissioned by Daniel Spoerri’s ""Eat Art Gallery"" in Düsseldorf, Roth’s ""Shit Hare"" can be seen in relation to the output of – and experimentation with – organic and edible works in the 1960s in and around this gallery’s influence. In addition, Roth taught at the Düsseldorf Art Academy, where the influential Joseph Beuys was his colleague. Beuys’ encouragement of expanding the ideas of sculpture and art was responsible for effecting a whole generation of artists coming out of the school. His mythological imbuing of animals, especially the hare (for both its religious connotations and its procreative powers), the most obvious of which is ""How to Explain Pictures to a Dead Hare"", 1965 is indeed an interesting consideration when thinking about Roth’s ""Shit Hare"". Provocation and commentary – favored tactics of Roth’s – enter the interpretation of the ""Shit Hare"", and provide a lighthearted countering to Beuys’ self-opposed spiritual and philosophical weight.

As a fluxing agent, lead oxide lowers the melting point of a glaze, reducing the amount of fuel required for firing. Copper and iron metal oxides were added to the glaze to impart the green and brown colors reminiscent of bronzes with different patinas; they were thus especially useful for glazing ceramic wares that imitated more expensive bronze ritual vessels. The decorative elements on these objects—mystical mountains with swirling clouds, mythical beasts, immortal figures, and bear-form supports—are associated with cosmological realms of immortals and closely replicate the relief ornamentation on sumptuous Han bronzes. Although the tombs of the most wealthy and important Han personages continued to be furnished luxuriously, ceramic reproductions of expensive burial goods and tomb sculptures representing animals, servants, and entertainers became acceptable substitutes for real objects and living creatures.",Chinese,173592,H. 23 x Diam. 14.8 cm (9 1/16 x 5 13/16 in.)

Bolton III, Agnes Gund and Daniel Shapiro, Richard E. Oldenburg, and Emily Rauh Pulitzer in honor of Neil and Angelica Rudenstine",2001-04-09T00:00:00-04:00,Modern and Contemporary Art,,210,2001.0,Drawings,https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:30687_dynmc,,"Ellsworth Kelly's works on paper from the late 1940s to the early 1950s played a seminal role in the development of his art. Executed in France, where he lived from 1948 to 1954, the five drawings under gift and purchase consideration are crucial works in Kelly's development of a highly individualized and radically original strategy for making his art. 

The four beach-cabana drawings are clear examples of Kelly deriving abstract form from observed reality and chance encounter. While spending time at the beach at Meschers, a resort on the Atlantic coast of France, Kelly took a number of photographs and made six elaborate sketches of beach cabanas. Recorded in deadpan style, shown frontally and parallel to the picture plane, the drawings reveal how Kelly's attention was drawn not to the striped design of the cabana fabric but to the random motif of the many patched repairs that by chance upset the orderliness of the of the pattern. As Kelly later noted: ""Everywhere I looked, everything I saw became something to be made, and it had to be exactly as it was, with nothing added. It was a new freedom: there was no longer the need to compose. The subject was there already made, and I could take from everything. It all belonged to me: a glass roof of a factory with its broken and patched panels, lines on a road map..., paper fragments in the street. It was all the same: anything goes."" [1] Although the world around Kelly became a sourcebook of ready-made compositions, his transfer or translation of the original referent was always distilled and recast in an entirely abstract idiom. He was never concerned with conveying any memory or metaphoric connotation of the original motif, focusing instead on the pictorial and entirely abstract concerns that have preoccupied him in both his sculpture and painting to this day. 

In 1951, the transfer process begins to fade from Kelly's work and a new focus on the structure of the grid and a emphasis on color come to the fore. This shift seems to have been precipitated by two events. First, Kelly, who was teaching at the American School in Paris, had a dream which he sketched upon awakening. Kelly recalled how in the dream he ""was working on a scaffold with a lot of children, creating an immense mural composed of square panels..."" [2] In response, Kelly cut up an existing drawing into little squares which he then randomly arranged in a grid and glued onto a fresh sheet of paper. Second, the artist discovered papier gommette, the brightly colored gummed paper used in French kindergartens. Initially, he used tiny squares of the gummed paper in eight large and vibrant collages, all based on a modular grid, the series entitled ""Spectrum Colors Arranged by Chance."" Whereas some of the Spectrum collages have as many as 1600 pieces of the paper glued down, in his subsequent work, Kelly dramatically enlarged the size of the color units into long bands and then finally, as in the ""Nine Colors"" series, divided the units into separate color panels. ""Nine Colors on White I"" from 1953, is the first of a large series of these pared down drawings based on just nine color blocks and conceived with a multipanel work in mind. Through the reworking of the basic arrangement of the color blocks, Kelly explored numerous possible configurations and permutations, the only constants among the collages being the color arrangement and the sense of color and surface fused as one.

The remains of a cross-hatched aegis, the snake-lined cape usually associated with Athena, are visible behind the figure. The rump of a snake survives at the elbow of the bent, proper right arm. Other figurines from the same mold indicate that the aegis continued on the other side, i.e. the front of the figure. On the present example, an uneven break edge is all that survives.

In drawing with twigs, some as much as two feet long, Marden distanced himself not just literally from the image but also from the mundane and routine virtuoso concerns of traditional draftsmanship. He found the quasi-calligraphic process curiously meditative and spiritual, a means not only to explore a long-standing interest in gesture and touch, but also a means to connect more closely with nature: ""I am seeing my life as part of the struggle between man and nature. I know there is the possibility of some sort of union. This is why I have been forced to take nature as my inspiration."" [1] Much of the exploration of his relationship to nature has taken place in a remarkable series of Work Books, in which Marden creates whole sequences of drawings. Sometimes the drawings are made in rapid succession, one after another, other times they are created over a period of years such that the individual drawings are independent, although not isolated, from one another.

As a fluxing agent, lead oxide lowers the melting point of a glaze, reducing the amount of fuel required for firing. Copper and iron metal oxides were added to the glaze to impart the green and brown colors reminiscent of bronzes with different patinas; they were thus especially useful for glazing ceramic wares that imitated more expensive bronze ritual vessels. The decorative elements on these objects—mystical mountains with swirling clouds, mythical beasts, immortal figures, and bear-form supports—are associated with cosmological realms of immortals and closely replicate the relief ornamentation on sumptuous Han bronzes. Although the tombs of the most wealthy and important Han personages continued to be furnished luxuriously, ceramic reproductions of expensive burial goods and tomb sculptures representing animals, servants, and entertainers became acceptable substitutes for real objects and living creatures.",Chinese,174177,H. 25.8 x Diam. 20 cm (10 3/16 x 7 7/8 in.)

In drawing with twigs, some as much as two feet long, Marden distanced himself not just literally from the image but also from the mundane and routine virtuoso concerns of traditional draftsmanship. He found the quasi-calligraphic process curiously meditative and spiritual, a means not only to explore a long-standing interest in gesture and touch, but also a means to connect more closely with nature: ""I am seeing my life as part of the struggle between man and nature. I know there is the possibility of some sort of union. This is why I have been forced to take nature as my inspiration."" [1] Much of the exploration of his relationship to nature has taken place in a remarkable series of Work Books, in which Marden creates whole sequences of drawings. Sometimes the drawings are made in rapid succession, one after another, other times they are created over a period of years such that the individual drawings are independent, although not isolated, from one another.

Within the red square stands a nude female figure, meant to represent Aphrodite, with yellow drapery and blond curls. She holds a mirror in her right hand and gazes into it. Smaller figures (putti) stand on either side of her acting as attendants. The putto on the right holds out a small orange wreath with which to crown Aphrodite. Around this scene runs a brown border. 
Outside the inner square is an orange field containing an arrangement of roundels, plants, and birds. In each corner of the square sits a small red medallion outlined in white containing a putto that may be carrying fish or other symbols of abundance. Between the roundels are blue vases (kantharoi) with pink and red collars; from each vase emerge two, symmetrical coiling vines that end in bunches of purple grapes. The kantharoi on the left and right sides of the square have pairs of birds sitting amongst vines. The kantharoi at top and bottom have pairs of birds flanking them, again sitting in vines. The square has a dark blue outer border with geometric palmettes and dots; tendrils and leaves sprout from each corner. At the very top of the fragment might be a reinforced selvedge.

Loeb",2001-03-23T00:00:00-05:00,Modern and Contemporary Art,,767,2001.0,Multiples,,,"Dieter Roth (1930-1998) was a Swiss-German sculptor, poet, graphic designer, performer, publisher, musician, and most of all, provocateur. His interest in ephemeral materials and experimentation with different kinds of food (chocolate, dough, candy, bread) began in the mid 1960s. Attempting to visualize the dimension of time, Roth wanted his works to have a life of their own. The objects were and are literally still changing (decaying) after they were ""finished,"" and the entrance of other life forms – such as insects and bacteria – allowed for the continuation of life in art. Roth was also interested in the factor of chance in art making. The work could not be fully controlled by the artist, but developed according to the conditions in which it was kept. Temperature, humidity, light, and the presence of other insect or bacterial life form continue to alter the object.

The ""Chocolate Lion"", 1971 was planned in an edition of 210 in dark, white, and marbled chocolate. But, according to the artist, he produced less than 100 between 1969-1971 (Dobke, no. 1969.13). This object, also known as ""Self-portrait as a Lion"", reveals the artist's wit – and even nose-thumbing – as its construction from a material is so opposite in stability from that of the traditional sculpted portrait in bronze. As such, it remains closer to a true ""portrait"" of the artist as a human body that lives, changes and dies. In terms of representation even, the ""Chocolate Lion"" counteracts the traditional, stern painted self-portrait, for example, of Max Beckmann's canonical ""Self-portrait in Tuxedo"", 1927. Furthermore, the ""lion"" Roth presents to the viewer looks more like a very unthreatening dog.

Chocolate is also culturally connoted with positive feelings: it is sweet, gratifying, and connected often times to childhood rewards and memories. By working in such a material, Roth creates a sort of sugary bridge to the museum audience, yet not to the museum as an institution itself. Chocolate, for example, is much more connected with the everyday lives and experiences of the viewer than is cast bronze or copper. In short, Roth plays with the dichotomy of audience and institution by varying the artistic elements of material and form. For Roth, food was a vehicle for concepts and critique of the art world itself – change and growth are seen in opposition to the institutionalization of ideas and art.",,,Marbled chocolate,Chocolate Lion (Self-Portrait as a Lion),Purchase,"Private Collector, North Rhine Westphalia, Auction, Germany, 1990, 2001.

As a fluxing agent, lead oxide lowers the melting point of a glaze, reducing the amount of fuel required for firing. Copper and iron metal oxides were added to the glaze to impart the green and brown colors reminiscent of bronzes with different patinas; they were thus especially useful for glazing ceramic wares that imitated more expensive bronze ritual vessels. The decorative elements on these objects—mystical mountains with swirling clouds, mythical beasts, immortal figures, and bear-form supports—are associated with cosmological realms of immortals and closely replicate the relief ornamentation on sumptuous Han bronzes. Although the tombs of the most wealthy and important Han personages continued to be furnished luxuriously, ceramic reproductions of expensive burial goods and tomb sculptures representing animals, servants, and entertainers became acceptable substitutes for real objects and living creatures.",Chinese,174848,H. 6.4 x L. 12.9 x W. 5.7 cm (2 1/2 x 5 1/16 x 2 1/4 in.)

This connection is underscored by the donors’ decision to dedicate the painting to Fried. Like the gift of Deborah and Martin Hale, ""Red Painting, 1999"", Marioni's ""Yellow Painting"" is one of a group of four paintings made by the artist specifically for Harvard's Fogg Art Museum.

Marioni self-consciously responds to the painting of a number of artists already in the Fogg's collections, especially to Pollock; Rothko; Noland; Louis; Stella and Marden; even more specifically to Robert Ryman, whose ""Untitled"" 1958 and ""Untitled"" 1959 are on longterm loan to the Fogg. During the 1980’s, Marioni also instigated a series of dialogues and exhibition projects with the German painter Gunter Umberg, around the European concept of ""concrete"" painting.   Like Ryman, who, in his mostly white paintings, has extracted seemingly unlimited outcomes by varying the organization and manner of his strokes, the type and density of his pigments, and the nature of his support surface and attachments of support to wall, Marioni has adapted a Minimalist reliance on permutations of a set of pre-determined variables, in his case, sticking to monochrome acrylic on canvas, but introducing a broad range of color. Marioni, however, paints with a roller, eliminating the constructive element of the stroke. In this, his project is at once more phenomenological, more iconic, and more anthropomorphic than his Abstract Expressionist or Minimalist predecessors. Marioni’s preference for an unmediated application of paint echoes Pollock, but toward different ends: he is interested in allowing the paint ""to be what it naturally is, liquid color,"" and he aims to avoid any intimation of drawing. At the same time, his layered pigments incorporate stain, but are not about staining; he relishes the corporeal association of paint with skin. Marioni has referred repeatedly to his  interest in the fundamentally iconic essence of painting -- he says this as an observant Catholic --  citing both Veronica’s veil (the painting as relic) and Malevich as inspiration toward this end. His paintings alternate between overtly iconic, square formats and more vertical, larger scale planes. In both cases, Marioni treats the entire painting as image and works to inspire a private dialogue between the painting and its viewer.",,,Acrylic and linen on strectcher,Yellow Painting,Gift,"[Howard Yezerksi Gallery, Boston, Massachusetts], sold; to Harvard University Art Museums, 2000.",1999,Department of Modern & Contemporary Art,1999,"[{'role': 'Artist', 'birthplace': 'Cincinnati, OH', 'gender': 'male', 'displaydate': '1943 - 2024', 'prefix': None, 'culture': 'American', 'displayname': 'Joseph Marioni', 'alphasort': 'Marioni, Joseph', 'name': 'Joseph Marioni', 'personid': 20086, 'deathplace': 'New York, NY', 'displayorder': 1}]",https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/174914,20th century,2000.241,,American,174914,243.8 x 182.9 cm (96 x 72 in.)

Artificial lighting in the Roman Empire was accomplished with torches, candles and lamps. Torches were used outdoors, while candles made of wax were used mainly in areas that did not have olive oil. Lamps were the most common means of light, used all over the Empire, but especially where oil was produced or imported. 

Lamps range from decorative to functional, though all utilize the same basic features. The oil chamber inside holds the fuel, while the hole at the top is for filling. There is usually a nozzle and a wick-hole for wicks that were made of fibrous materials, most often linen. Lamps themselves could be made in bronze, lead, iron, gold, silver, glass, or stone. However, the most common construction material for lamps was pottery. Though they could be made by hand or on a potter's wheel, they were most often constructed in molds. 

First, the maker would construct a clay archetype of the lamp that would be solid, not hollow. Then a plaster mold would be made of the archetype. The mold would often be two parts, an upper and lower part, that wet clay could be pressed into to make a new lamp. When the clay was leather-hard, additional decorations, stamps, or handles could be added, and the wick and filling holes were pierced. A coat of slip was put on before the lamp would be fired in a kiln. 

Lamps were distributed both by local workshops and by export from specialty workshops. There is some archaeological evidence for specific names of workshops and their trade routes, but still much is unknown about these factories. Sometimes makers left marks on the bottom of their lamps, which can help archaeologists in determining where the lamp was originally from.
                                        
This miniature lamp with a delta-shaped palmette ornament above the handle falls into D.M. Bailey's Type D (BMC Vol.II). Due to its characteristics, it can be dated to the first three quarters of the first century AD, and it was most likely produced in an Italian workshop.

Very few Romans were able to write. Usually only upper-class men, and sometimes women, were literate. Young boys were often trained to read and write by Greek slaves who were brought to Rome as teachers. Members of lower-class families would never attend school, since they were required to work from a young age. Upper-class children usually started primary school around the age of seven and moved up to grammaticus, or grammar school, around age twelve. There they would learn Greek and rhetoric, which was the climax of a Roman education.  

Writing was practiced with a stylus, which was often made of bone or ivory and had a pointed tip. A stylus was used to write on a wax tablet, which would have a wooden border and flat wax in the center. After practicing letters, the wax could be smoothed over to make a clean surface upon which one could write again.

(For drawings with related motifs of the mid-60s, see the exhibition catalogues Sigmar Polke: Works on Paper, 1963-1974 [New York: MoMA, 199], cat. nos. 31, 79, and 175, and Sigmar Polke: Zeichnungen [etc.] [Bonn, 1988], no. 413.) This drawing sets the palm into an octagonal frame (a picture? a decorative tile?), which is then further surrounded by the sketched-in forms of a possibly three-dimensional structure and an encircling oval (for related use of irregularly shaped enframing lines, shadowed in black, see MoMA cat. no. 85, also of 1966). Above these somewhat tentative compositional explorations is a second image, a schematic representation of a sunset (or sunrise) with reflections in clouds and the water's waves -- an almost Munch- or Gauguin-like rendering of an equally romantic landscape of desire. While this drawing does not have the cartoon-like immediacy and crudity of many of Polke's other images of the 1960s (especially those jokey drawings using ball-point pen of 1963 and the following years), the unresolved working-out of the format and image give it a freshness and a tension that other such works sometimes lack.",,,Watercolor and graphite on squared off-white wove paper,Untitled (Palms),Purchase,"Sigmar Polke, 1966.

In 1932 Bisttram settled in Taos, and he eventually played an important role in establishing Taos as a regional center for the visual arts. He studied with Diego Rivera in Mexico in 1931 and worked as a muralist in the mid-1930s. A founder of the Transcendental Painting Group, Bisttram proceeded from the realism documented in the Fogg's watercolor, ""Storm Clouds"" (1997.209), to a non-objective art with a strong spiritual component, although he continued to produce both realist and abstract works throughout his career.

As a fluxing agent, lead oxide lowers the melting point of a glaze, reducing the amount of fuel required for firing. Copper and iron metal oxides were added to the glaze to impart the green and brown colors reminiscent of bronzes with different patinas; they were thus especially useful for glazing ceramic wares that imitated more expensive bronze ritual vessels. The decorative elements on these objects—mystical mountains with swirling clouds, mythical beasts, immortal figures, and bear-form supports—are associated with cosmological realms of immortals and closely replicate the relief ornamentation on sumptuous Han bronzes. Although the tombs of the most wealthy and important Han personages continued to be furnished luxuriously, ceramic reproductions of expensive burial goods and tomb sculptures representing animals, servants, and entertainers became acceptable substitutes for real objects and living creatures.",Chinese,186747,H. 27.7 x Diam. 21.1 cm (10 7/8 x 8 5/16 in.)

This issue of ""Assembling"" is the first volume in a series that would be issued annually over the next decade or more. One of ""Assembling""'s editors, Richard Kostelanetz, began another periodical in 1977, ""Precisely,""  which was more oriented toward criticism, but its introduction conveys the same anti-establishment sentiments, directed toward the current vogue in art-world status, official grants to projects: ""This initial issue appears without any assistance whatsoever from the NEA, NYSCA, CCLM or the Canada Council, which is to say that its purposes are eminently serious and eleemosynary.""  An essay in that issue was also devoted to artist's books, evidencing the interest continuing in the art form embodied by ""Assembling.""

Longshan black pottery vessels with design elements reminiscent of hammered metal also imply the influence of metalwork during the latter part of this otherwise Neolithic culture. Following closely after the Longshan period, Erlitou culture sites in Henan and Shanxi provinces reveal a complex, hierarchical society that produced bronze tools, weapons, vessels, and turquoise-inlaid plaques (such as those displayed here) of astonishing sophistication.

Ushabtis are ancient Egyptian funerary figurines that were buried with a deceased person (the owner) and designed to perform tasks for them in the afterlife.

They were believed to be “activated” when the deceased owner recited a portion of the Book of the Dead that explained the ushabti’s duties, which is sometimes inscribed on them (see 2019.354 for an example of this text). In such inscriptions, the deceased person is referred to as the “illuminated Osiris”—a gesture toward the hope that they would be resurrected like the god Osiris and everlasting like the sun. Ushabtis were almost always made in sets so that there would be many figurines to serve the deceased person. A full set comprised 401 ushabtis: one “worker” ushabti for every day of the year, plus one “overseer” ushabti for every ten, to make sure the rest were doing their jobs.

An assemblage which featured the derogatory Mammy of the flapjack mix armed with grenades and a rifle standing behind a symbolic fist of black power, the work imploded feminist and racist stereotypes, and it is to this theme of militant Mammies that Saar returns in this print.  Here, Aunt Jemima is devoid of grenades and rifle, but is armed rather with a bandana inscribed 'LIBERATION,' from which shoots out a profusion of fearsome flames.  Fire is a recurring sign of the occult that the artist often combines with contemporary imagery to suggest her exploration of a cross-cultural past couched in the present.  In this print, a varnished lithographic cut-out of Aunt Jemima juts out from the lower corner over a standard lithographic background of orange/red flames that contrast against the predominantly blueish purple field.  The print presents some enigmas of technique for a mass-produced planographic work: each letter on the bandana has been embellished with a depressed linear outline, while the cut-out eyes of the figure seem to have been washed over with additional color.

Ushabtis are ancient Egyptian funerary figurines that were buried with a deceased person (the owner) and designed to perform tasks for them in the afterlife. They were usually inscribed with the owner’s name. They were believed to be “activated” when the deceased owner recited a portion of the Book of the Dead that explained the ushabti’s duties, which is sometimes inscribed on them (see 2019.354 for an example of this text). In such inscriptions, the deceased person is referred to as the “illuminated Osiris”—a gesture toward the hope that they would be resurrected like the god Osiris and everlasting like the sun. Ushabtis were almost always made in sets so that there would be many figurines to serve the deceased person. A full set comprised 401 ushabtis: one “worker” ushabti for every day of the year, plus one “overseer” ushabti for every ten, to make sure the rest were doing their jobs. This ushabti is an overseer.

Fired at relatively low temperatures, earthenware vessels are not fully vitrified and are slightly porous, making them less than ideal as containers for daily use, but suitable as burial items.

However, the specific combination of individual characteristics of this figurine, as well as a few details, like the delineated feet and plinth, do not find consistent, reliable parallel among the terracotta figurines from those and other sites. This object may be a modern creation—that is, a forgery. Further research may clarify its (in?)authenticity but, at present, typological and technical examinations have been inconclusive.",Handmade,"A nude female figure stands on a low, square base. Incised chevron-shaped marks across the top front of the head indicate hair or a headdress; the top of the head is concave. The eyes are large and round, formed by applied circular pellets deeply indented in center with a circular, pointed tool. The nose is prominent, triangular and beak-like. No mouth is indicated. On either side of the face, three round indented pellets (formed like the eyes) represent hair (“perforated curls”?), ears, or part of a headdress. On the back of the head, hair or a headdress in the shape of a truncated crescent gives the appearance of a bobbed haircut and is decorated by short vertical incisions.

The figure wears a necklace or collar that is made, in the front, of a broad applied strip incised into three tiers and decorated with short, diagonal hatch marks (alternating direction in each tier to create a chevron-like effect). On the figure’s back, this applied necklace connects to incised lines, continuing each tier as a deep “V” that turns to vertical lines reaching the waist (and the groove at back between the legs).

Broad shoulders slope downwards. The arms are bent at the elbow, with hands held to breasts. On each wrist, a bracelet is indicated by incised outline and linear decoration. Fingers are sketchily incised, with five on the proper right hand and six on the proper left. A round indentation marks the navel, below which hips broaden sideways from a narrow torso. The pubic triangle is delineated by outline and filled by short, diagonal incised hatches. Legs, which taper from the hips toward the base, are marked by a deep central groove on both front and back, indicative of the forming technique (the arm and leg on each side were formed by a roll of clay; each side was joined together at the figure’s torso, with an additional piece of clay to form the head and neck joined horizontally at the level of the shoulder). On the back, there are two round indentations above the hips on the back. The buttocks are modeled.

At the bottom, the legs merge into a columnar shape that broadens toward the base, though the groove separating the legs is retained at the front. From this, feet are articulated at front and on the frontal portion of the sides; they are not indicated on the back. The toes are delineated by incision, with five toes on the proper right and six on the left. The front face of the base is decorated with diagonal hatch marks, creating a chevron pattern. Technical examination has shown that the base was detached and reattached in the past; it is not clear whether the base is or is not original to the object.

These figurines—with their curious faces (sometimes deemed “bird-like”), elaborate headdresses, and emphatic hips—are puzzling. Examples like numbers 1–4 [1998.15.16; 1992.256.12.1–3; 2022.242.1–3; 1969.177.86.1–2] have been found across today’s northern Syria and southeastern Türkiye (Turkey) in sanctuaries and graves dating from the second millennium BCE. Their applied breasts and incised pubic triangles mark them as female, encouraging modern interpretations about fertility and sexuality. Number 5 [1953.118], likely made on the island of Cyprus, shows similar features, attesting to ideas about female bodies shared between distant but connected communities of the eastern Mediterranean and western Asia during the Bronze Age. 
Who exactly do they depict? Goddesses or worshippers? Both or neither? Any answers are complicated by wrinkles in their modern stories that raise a more urgent question: are these objects even ancient? 
All six figurines moved through the art market without documented findspots, making it difficult to interpret them or even assess their authenticity. Number 6 [1999.252] may be a modern forgery.

At Ephesos, syncretism associated the Greek Artemis with the iconography and aspects of an earlier deity who had a clear connection with fertility. Other large- and small-scale representations of Ephesian Artemis are known in marble, bronze, and terracotta, but the niche surrounding the goddess and stags is perhaps unique to this object. The temple of Artemis at Ephesos was acknowledged in antiquity as one of the Seven Wonders of the World.",Molded,"This terracotta statuette group is a representation of the Artemis of Ephesos. The goddess stands frontally, arms held out from her sides. She wears a high headdress (kalathos), and behind her head is a billowing veil or nimbus; her garment is long and close fitting, covered in the central section by a cluster of globular objects generally identified as breasts. The lower part of the garment, although now very worn, may have had panels with raised depictions of animals in imitation of the cult statues of the goddess.

On either side of the goddess stands a stag. The stags are rather cursorily modeled; their antlers are depicted almost like a large feather above the head, with a row of incised lines on either side of a central incision. The goddess and animals are enclosed in a round-topped niche, standing on a rectangular base with molding depicted on the top and bottom, possibly in imitation of the settings of larger statues of the goddess.

Roman lamps are typically made of either terracotta or bronze and are mold-made. Typically, the body is round and closed on top and there is a nozzle with a pick. Terracotta lamps are usually decorated with a wide variety of motifs. In houses, lamps may have stood on the top of a candelabrum (See: 1960.482) to light a room.

Likely modeled upon more prestigious examples in bronze, this double-nozzled lamp is an unusually large example with decorations that represent gladiatorial themes.The leg-greaves, wrist-guards, helmets, and shields found on the discus identify the gladiators as Thracian and Samnite (1). With the scene of Victory on the handle this lamp may commemorate a particular series of games.

",Mold-made,"Very large terracotta lamp.  Broad base.  Underside of deep reservoir flares up- and outward with almost straight walls.  Slightly sloping rim separated from sunken discus by two ridges defined by narrower ridges.  Discus decorated in relief with gladiatorial accoutrements: a pair of leg-greaves, a pair of wrist-guards, two shields, two swords, and two helmets.  Small central filling hole surrounded by a ridge also surrounded on either side by a narrower ridge.  Double volute nozzle with broad tips and large wick holes.  Some restoration at tips of nozzles.  Double-leaf or heart-shaped decoration between volutes on the bridge of each nozzle.  Horizontal perforated handle supports large, intact triangular handle ornament with decoration in relief: Victory standing beside an altar, holding a cornucopia in her right hand and a trophy (tropaeum) in her left.  A shield rests on the altar.  Victory is flanked by two Lares (household gods) presenting ritual offerings.

In her Roman guise, the goddess also held political connotations as the mother of the Roman state and sometimes appears in a more regal composition, clothed and with accoutrements such as a diadem and scepter (1).

Common in the Late Bronze Age in both Crete and mainland Greece, stirrup jars-with a false mouth and double handles that resemble a stirrup-were used for the storage and transport of liquids such as oil. The shoulder of this example is decorated with stylized sea snails. 
",Wheel-made,"Large ovoid stirrup jar. Broad ring base. Rounded body with maximum diameter above center. Broad shoulder with narrow, tubular spout and slightly flaring rim, positioned vertically. False spout behind it, at top of jar, is of the same height and terminates in a broadly flaring, slightly concave disc. Short, broad strap handles are attached to the rim of the false spout and the upper shoulder of the jar. 

Pale buff material decorated with a burnt umber slip. Slip variously solid and streaky in application. Glossy surface. Exterior of ring base slipped. Above this are three narrow bands of decoration on the body and lower shoulder of the vessel. The lowermost of these is a banded zone consisting of two thin lines flanked by a thick band above and below.  The middle zone contains a triglyph-style frieze with rectangular spaces filled with billowy lines alternating with largely blank spaces bordered along the top edge by small pendant loops. Another banded zone is contained above this, at mid-shoulder level, with several thin lines again flanked by the thicker ones. Marine mollusc shells, stippled in rows and seen in profile, decorate the jar's shoulder. Disc surface of false spout decorated with a spiral. Handles are entirely orange-slipped, save for a reserved triangle at their junction with the rim of the false spout. A figure-eight shaped band runs around the bases of the spout and false spout.

Excavations at several Longshan culture sites along the middle and lower Yellow River valleys have yielded tools, ornaments, and vessel fragments made of bronze. Longshan black pottery vessels with design elements reminiscent of hammered metal also imply the influence of metalwork during the latter part of this otherwise Neolithic culture. Following closely after the Longshan period, Erlitou culture sites in Henan and Shanxi provinces reveal a complex, hierarchical society that produced bronze tools, weapons, vessels, and turquoise-inlaid plaques (such as those displayed here) of astonishing sophistication. The presence of such artifacts, along with the remains of bronze-casting molds at Erlitou, confirms that China had fully entered its Bronze Age by the second millennium BCE.",Chinese,193292,H. 16.2 x Diam. 8.1 cm (6 3/8 x 3 3/16 in.)

A design for a larger composition, the drawing shows the working method by which Lozano arrived at her hermetic, mathematically inspired paintings. The fact that it includes four alternate designs on the same sheet only makes it more interesting as a teaching object. The machine aesthetic of the precisionist movement, so influential on Lozano's work in the late 1960's, is evident in the mathematic deliberateness of the drawing and the metallic sheen of the graphite. Lozano's works are particularly rare on account of her withdrawal from the art world and even from the production of art around 1970. This ""personal and public revolution"" which includes an ongoing boycott of contact with other women, has become her ultimate artwork. The recognition of Lozano's importance to the history of contemporary art has grown in recent years and this drawing should be considered an important acquisition of an artist whose place in history, albeit unusual, is assured.",,"The drawing is a study for a larger composition, yet to be identified.

As a fluxing agent, lead oxide lowers the melting point of a glaze, reducing the amount of fuel required for firing. Copper and iron metal oxides were added to the glaze to impart the green and brown colors reminiscent of bronzes with different patinas; they were thus especially useful for glazing ceramic wares that imitated more expensive bronze ritual vessels. The decorative elements on these objects—mystical mountains with swirling clouds, mythical beasts, immortal figures, and bear-form supports—are associated with cosmological realms of immortals and closely replicate the relief ornamentation on sumptuous Han bronzes. Although the tombs of the most wealthy and important Han personages continued to be furnished luxuriously, ceramic reproductions of expensive burial goods and tomb sculptures representing animals, servants, and entertainers became acceptable substitutes for real objects and living creatures.",Chinese,195611,H. 45 x Diam. 35 cm (17 11/16 x 13 3/4 in.)

Standing Three-Headed Shiva
India, Kashmir, Karakota period, 8th–9th century 
Dark gray chlorite
Arthur M. Sackler Museum, Ernest B. and Helen Pratt Dane Fund for the Acquisition of Oriental Art, 1990.1

In the early centuries of the medieval period, Kashmir was a flourishing center of Hindu and Buddhist practices where several cults developed, including localized forms of Shaivism, the worship of the Hindu god Shiva. This work depicts a common icon in the Kashmiri Shaivite tradition, a three-headed form of Shiva known as Maheshvara (great lord). His smooth, rounded form, squat proportions, and flattened features closely resemble the artistic style that developed just before and during the rule of the Kashmiri king Avantivarman (r. c. 855–83). Kashmir was at the cross¬roads between India and the provincial Hellenistic region of Gandhara to the north. The suggestion of musculature in Shiva’s torso reveals the lingering influence of Gandharan styles upon Kashmiri art.

The three heads express different aspects of this manifold deity. A smiling female, a benign male, and a violent male perhaps correspond to Shiva’s powers as creator, protector, and destroyer. The now missing arms would have held additional emblems to communicate the god’s cosmic powers.
Sacred texts describe Shiva’s complex and paradoxical character. Probably developing around 200 BCE, Shaivism, or the worship of Shiva, had become widespread in India by the late sixth century. A multitude of visual forms—abstract and anthropomorphic—arose to represent Shiva’s grace, energy, and mythic exploits. The rounded forms, well-modeled musculature, and controlled exuberance of this figure characterize the sculptural style that developed in late ninth-century Kashmir, during the reign of the Karkota dynasty (625–1003).",,200467,66.7 x 25.2 x 11.4 cm (26 1/4 x 9 15/16 x 4 1/2 in.)

This miniature pitcher shape is called a “chous” in ancient Greek. Made in Athens, this vessel type was popular in the late 5th century BCE.
These little pitchers are connected to a spring festival in Athens called the Anthesteria, a festival of Dionysos that was especially connected to the new wine of the year and the arrival of spring. Some scholars have suggested that these little pitchers were used in festival ritual for the first taste of wine for three-year old children. They are often decorated, appropriately, with child-related themes such as this.
The little dog is a type known in antiquity as a Melitan (Maltese) dog. It is commonly depicted as a pet in ancient Greek art (see the grave stele of Melisto, 1961.86, for another depiction of a child teasing a Melitan dog in the collection).

The fragment shown is just one small part of a much larger decorative scheme that would have covered an entire wall. 

The small piece comes from a much larger composition that most likely decorated a wall in the interior of a Roman home. The style of intricate wall painting seen here became popular during the reign of Augustus in the late first century BCE-early first century CE (1). The light and delicate decoration floats on a black background with little to no sense of depth or volume.

Masks are frequent motifs in frescoes of this period where they often appear tucked amongst architectural elements including aediculae or columns (2).

Although it has not been possible to find evidence proving that the original order for casts was filled exactly as requested, old photographs of Hunt Hall, the original Fogg Museum building, show that all of the slabs visible in the photographs correspond with those ordered by Moore in 1895. However, not all of the slabs that were ordered by Moore appear in the photographs. It is possible that Brucciani did not have moulds available for all of the slabs on Moore's list and therefore may not have sent all of them.  Moore may also have ordered more casts than could be used by the museum, although we do not know what was done with them . The following slabs can be seen in old photographs of Hunt Hall : West frieze, Michaelis nos. I-XI (these slabs correspond with Moore's original order except for no.

However, these two fragments were not original to each other. This composite or “pastiche” object has been disassembled and the fragments are now accessioned individually, as 1969.177.86.1 (head and torso) and 1969.177.86.2 (legs). The clay fabrics of the two fragments do not match each other: this is clear from X-radiography, which indicated that the materials were different (e.g., different density and inclusions), as well as from visible inspection of the terracotta. Additionally, once the fragments were separated and the modern filling materials were removed, it was apparent that the breaks did not match.

The relationship between the fragments is not clear. Several scenarios are possible: (1) the fragments are from two different ancient figurines (a “pastiche” of ancient fragments); (2) one fragment (such as the legs) was made in the 20th century to complete the other fragment (which in this scenario would, presumably, be ancient); (3) both fragments are modern.

These fragments are fairly typical examples of a category of figurines depicting a nude female figure with a “bird-like” face. These were made in the 2nd millennium BCE at sites across northern Syria (today’s eastern Turkey and northern Syria). Specifically, this figurine is in a form that comes from the region of the Orontes River. Such figurines are often interpreted as goddesses or divinities; the frequent depiction of breasts (not present here) and pubic triangles (present here) have encouraged interpretations of deities or domains of life pertaining to female sexuality and/or fertility. 

It is common for figurines of this type to be broken across the legs. It is not currently clear if this frequent breakage pattern is the result of intentional, perhaps ritual, breakage or merely indicates a common susceptibility of the figurines to breakage during use or deposition.

Further information on this type of figurine may be found in the following standard reference work (where falls into the category of Orontes Type MAI 2): Leila Badre. 1980.

These figurines—with their curious faces (sometimes deemed “bird-like”), elaborate headdresses, and emphatic hips—are puzzling. Examples like numbers 1–4 [1998.15.16; 1992.256.12.1–3; 2022.242.1–3; 1969.177.86.1–2] have been found across today’s northern Syria and southeastern Türkiye (Turkey) in sanctuaries and graves dating from the second millennium BCE. Their applied breasts and incised pubic triangles mark them as female, encouraging modern interpretations about fertility and sexuality. Number 5 [1953.118], likely made on the island of Cyprus, shows similar features, attesting to ideas about female bodies shared between distant but connected communities of the eastern Mediterranean and western Asia during the Bronze Age. 
Who exactly do they depict? Goddesses or worshippers? Both or neither? Any answers are complicated by wrinkles in their modern stories that raise a more urgent question: are these objects even ancient? 
All six figurines moved through the art market without documented findspots, making it difficult to interpret them or even assess their authenticity. Number 6 [1999.252] may be a modern forgery. And while numbers 2–4 [1992.256.12.1–3; 2022.242.1–3; 1969.177.86.1–2] arrived at Harvard as single objects, each, in fact, comprises several pieces that are not original to each other. It is not clear whether the fragments are all ancient, all modern, or a combination of both.

Their interactions generally center around the satyr’s sexual pursuit of the maenad. The satyr is intended to be a comic figure in that despite his overly exaggerated sexual arousal, he is never able to satisfy his desire since he is never able to successfully capture a woman.",Red-figure,"On the interior of this cup, a maenad (female follower of Dionysos) and a satyr dance facing each other, their arms outstretched and thrown up into the air. On the left, the maenad bows her head. She is wreathed with ivy and wears a long chiton (tunic) with many creases and folds. Her bent legs are visibly outlined through the fabric, suggesting its fineness and translucence. It is tied by a thin belt with tassels painted on in red. A leopard skin, an animal sacred to Dionysos, is draped over her upraised arm. In front of her, a nude satyr dances in a similar fashion, extended his right arm (partially preserved) in front of him and his left over his head. He also wears a red wreath of ivy leaves. His beard is long and hairy. The tip of his erection points upward. 

The exterior of this cup is decorated with a flurry of pursuit scenes where highly aroused satyrs attempt to court the fleeing and resistant maenads. The satyrs wear ivy wreaths, as do some of the maenads. Some of the maenads instead wear slim fillets tied around their hair. All the satyrs have leopard skins draped over their arms as they reach out in attempt to grab the maenads. All the maenads wear similar translucent chitons tied by a red belt, and two of them wear leopard skins, this time fastened at the neck. Their bodies are outlined beneath their clothing, revealing their various twists and poses as they resist the satyrs’ advances. Each carries a thyrsos, an ivy topped staff associated with Dionysos. On one side, a satyr even tries to grab the thyrsos to take it away from the maenad. On the other side, a maenad extends it in front of her, appearing to use it as a weapon against her pursuer. Behind her, a satyr caries a drinking horn, often a symbol of excessive wine consumption, which is emphasized by the wineskin hanging behind him in the background. A long-horned goat walks beneath the handle on one side, mirrored by a crawling satyr on the other, offering a humorous comparison between the satyr and the animal.

There are at least 14 surviving examples of this subject on Group E vases. This vase is unique among their output, and in Attic vase-painting generally, in its depiction of Eurytion on his hands and knees rather than on his back or side (but cf. a similar pose on a Chalkidian neck amphora Paris, Cabinet des Médailles 202, BAPD 909851).

The myth of Herakles and Geryon was famously told by the poet Stesichoros in the Geryoneis, a long lyric poem now only preserved in fragments, dating to the first half of the sixth century B.C. Some scholars have seen that poem as influential upon the depiction of the myth in archaic Greek art. See:

For one of his labors, Herakles was required to travel to Erytheia, an island in the far west, to take the cattle of Geryon, a triple-bodied monster. 

Herakles stands at the left of the scene, with a red beard, and wearing his characteristic lionskin over a short red tunic (chiton). He wears the head of the lion over his own, with its front legs tied over his chest, pulled in by a belt at his waist. The lionskin is decorated with incised double lines to represent the fur. In his right hand he holds a sword; his left hand is obscured by Geryon’s shields. 

At Herakles’ feet and behind his left leg there is a man crouching down on his hands and knees. This is Eurytion, Geryon’s henchman, who seems to have already been dispatched by Herakles. He wears a red tunic under another garment which is tied with a red belt, and a wool cap of a kind which characterises him as a peasant. 

Opposite Herakles is Geryon, depicted as three overlapping warriors. Each wears greaves, a helmet, and a cuirass, and carries a shield with its outer band in red; two of the helmets overlap with the decorative frieze above, and may have been originally painted in red. The three figures stand in with their left legs forward in unison; the closest and farthest wear red greaves while the middle has black greaves, which helps visually differentiate these three pairs of legs with identical poses. 

The warrior closest to the viewer turns back, facing towards the right, revealing the interior of his shield, and holding a rock in his hand, rather than a true weapon, indicating his monstrous nature. The middle warrior faces Herakles to the left, and seems to hold a spear up pointing at the hero’s face. His shield once had a device of the front half of a horse painted in added white but this is now barely visible. Only the top of the far warrior’s helmet is visible behind the other figures; his shield can be seen behind the middle warrior’s shield, and he perhaps holds the spear of which a small part can be seen between the shields and the figure of Eurytion. 

At the bottom right of the scene, between the monster’s legs, is his two-headed dog Orthros, whose nearest head wears a collar and has its neck painted in added red. Mythologically, this dog is the offspring of Typhon and Echidna, and therefore is the brother of the three-headed dog Cerberus who guarded the underworld.

On the other side: A nude warrior arming himself, watched by four figures. The warrior stands at the center, facing to the right, with red hair. He lifts up his left leg and holds a greave in front of it with both hands, about to put it on. On the ground below his left leg there is a crested helmet, with its added color worn off. 

To his left stand two male figures facing towards him; the leftmost is red-haired and bearded and wears a cloak around his lower half, with his chest exposed. The other figure is also red-haired and wears a cloak draped over his a long tunic. 

To the right of the warrior stands a woman, facing him and gesturing to him with her right hand. She wears a long belted dress (peplos) with incised decoration; the added color is lost. Her features are poorly preserved because her skin would have been painted with added white, which is lost. Behind her stands a bearded, red-haired nude male figure. The figures standing around the warrior may represent members of his family, farewelling him as he leaves for battle.

",Black-figure,"The central figure on this dipper is the wine god Dionysos, who stands between two large eyes. He walks to the right but turns his head to the left, his arms clutching the ivy vines which spread out throughout the background. His wreath, beard, shawl, and tunic are decorated with added red paint, making him appear more vibrant. The eyes flanking him are large eyes filled in with black with red pupils and irises. On either side of the handle next to the eyes are roosters whose feathers, combs, and wattles are brought out with red paint. In the background behind the roosters are lotus buds. The entire dipper mimics the anatomy of a face where the triangular Dionysos mimics a nose and the fan-like roosters the ears.","Terracotta, white ground",Kyathos (dipper): The Wine God Dionysos,Gift,"Munzen und Medaillen, Basel, 1968, sold; to Private Collector, Boston, 1969, gift; to Fogg Art Museum, 1969.",c. 510 BCE,Department of Ancient and Byzantine Art & Numismatics,-505,,https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/287381,6th century BCE,1969.15,,Greek,287381,"with handle: H. 14.4 x W. 15 cm (5 11/16 x 5 7/8 in.)

Mên sits on the back of the horse, turning his upper body to the right. He wears a Phrygian cap, a cloak over an elaborate tunic or segmented cuirass, and trousers. In his extended right hand is an offering bowl or patera. The ends of a crescent moon are visible behind his shoulders. The horse is shown with its left foreleg raised. It wears a simple bridle; there is a decorative band, perhaps part of a harness, across the chest, but no indication of a saddle. The horse's mane is wavy, in contrast to its tail, which is banded, and the hair of the god, which is depicted in straight strands in a style reminiscent of Alexander the Great. The statuette is rather stylized, with details like the eyes disproportionately large, and other details greatly simplified. Horse and rider are on a rectangular base, shown with a molded band at the top and bottom, perhaps in imitation of life-sized equestrian statue bases. The back of the statuette is relatively featureless, with only the folds of the cloak and details of the horse harness and statue base depicted.

This spoon is carved out of bone, which was a typical method for making household implements. There is some debate as to whether Romans used spoons when eating. They were definitely used for cosmetic and medicinal purposes, as well as for straining solids out of wine, and perhaps for serving food. Numerous silver spoons survive from antiquity, like those in the Mildenhall Treasure at the British Museum and the silver hoard from the House of the Menander in Pompeii. However, spoons made of silver would have belonged only to members of the very upper classes.

The Romans were the first to develop plumbing for transporting water into homes and buildings. The most common material for creating pipes was lead. The English word ""plumbing"" derives from the Latin word for lead (plumbum), which can also be seen as they symbol for lead on the period table, ""Pb.""

Though modern heath issues have been traced to the used of lead pipes, the Romans were rarely poisoned by them and did not know of the danger posed by the material. Roman water contained a large amount of calcium, which would build up a layer inside the pipes and prevent lead from permeating the water. Pipes were made by pouring sheets of lead, then bending them into a cylinder shape and soldering the edges. Diameters ranged depending upon the intended use of the pipe and how much water would flow through it.

Because plumbing was so prized, owners would inscribe their lead pipes in order to prevent theft. The inscription would name the either the manufacturer of the pipe or the owner. The pipes were inscribed with bronze stamps similar to those used on bricks and amphorae (see the stamped brick and amphora handle in this collection, as well as the bronze brick stamp).

In Athenian vase-painting, the iconography of these two figures regularly overlaps and it can be difficult to distinguish them. Broadly speaking, Triton is younger, and characterised by a more wild, animalistic nature by comparison with the old man Nereus who is more civilized, and is often even depicted in an entirely human form. 

The most important story involving Nereus was an encounter with Herakles, who was supposed to have wrestled him in order to make him reveal the location of the garden of the Hesperides. This is the account given in literary versions of the myth, but depictions of the struggle in vase-painting often substitute Triton for Nereus. 

A number of early vases (c. 590-570 B.C.E.) depict Heracles struggling with a fish-tailed Nereus, but by 560 B.C.E. painters begin to depict the subject in two distinct ways, with Heracles fighting either an anthropomorphic Nereus, or, much more commonly, a fish-tailed god who must usually be understood as Triton, and is explicitly identified as such by inscriptions on a handful of slightly later vases (London B223, BAPD 320266; Berlin F1906, BAPD 306469; Cambridge G54, BAPD 12709). 

Particularly important is London B223 (BAPD 320266) which includes the figure of Nereus watching the fight between Triton and Herakles, with all the figures identified by inscriptions, confirming that the two sea-gods were conceived of as different deities (Paris F298, BAPD 302299 also includes Nereus as a spectator to the fight, identified by an inscription). Nonetheless, the iconography of both figures overlaps substantially, and it is often impossible to say for sure whether a given fish-tailed god is Nereus or Triton. The question of exactly why Triton supplanted Nereus as Herakles’ opponent is difficult to answer and has been attributed by different scholars to historical and political events, to art historical development, and to literary influence. 

The figure on this vase has often been identified as Triton because of his half-man, half-fish nature, corresponding to the figure that is depicted fighting Herakles in vases of this period. However, comparison with other depictions of Nereus by the same painter suggest that he is probably better thought of as Nereus.

There is a particularly close resemblance to a figure who is undeniably Nereus on another vase by the Berlin Painter, the stamnos Munich 8738 (BAPD 201980). The stamnos also features a Nereid, with an almost identical pose to the Nereid on the Harvard vase, running towards him, supporting the notion that the Harvard vase depicts the same sea-god. One important difference, however, is that the Nereus on Munich vessel is depicted with lighter hair painted in dilute slip, suggestive of his old age, while the Harvard figure has his hair rendered in black and there are no obvious indications of his age.

Another Berlin Painter vase, the hydria London E162 (BAPD 202006), depicts the fight between Herakles and Nereus, and although Nereus is in human form, he, like the figure on the Harvard vase, wears a long cloak and holds both a scepter and a dolphin. 

The way that the figure’s cloak masks the transition from human to animal also resembles the Berlin Painter’s depictions of another ‘civilized’ hybrid creature, the centaur Chiron who, unlike the other wild and savage centaurs, was tutor to a number of heroes (Paris G186, BAPD 201959; Munich 8738, BAPD 201980), another point in favour of its identification with the relatively ‘civilized’ Nereus rather than Triton.

He faces to the right and carries a scepter in his right hand with his little finger extended, and a dolphin in his left, which he holds by the tail. He has long curly hair tied into a bun and a beard. He wears a wreath in added red on his head, and a cloak (himation) decorated with triple dot motifs over a long-sleeved tunic (chiton). Instead of legs, he has a huge fish tail, which rises out of the bottom of his cloak (which conceals the junction between man and fish) and curves around before it ends in a stylised crescent-shaped tail fin, more like a dolphin’s tail than a fish’s. The tail is slightly tinted with dilute glaze and is decorated with single dots in a grid-like arrangement, with a reserved stripe marked out along its length. There are two pairs of fins coming out of the tail.

On the other side: presumably a Nereid. The Nereids were the sea-nymph daughters of Nereus, the most famous of whom is Thetis, the mother of Achilles.

This woman is not specifically identified by an inscription or by any iconographical detail, but we can be reasonably sure from the context – alongside the sea god – that she is a Nereid.

Porfido Rosso is also known as porphyry which is a very hard, reddish-purple stone dotted with white specks. It originates in Egypt, which came under Roman control in 30 BCE after the defeat of Cleopatra by Octavian (Augustus). 

Porphyry came to signify imperial command, as it was the choice stone of later emperors. Though its hardness made it difficult to work with, porphyry was often used in tombs, columns, and statues. The most well-known example of porphyry is the statue of the four tetrarchs commissioned by Diocletian.

Some scholars have identified this site with the ancient city of Pometia, but this identification remains unconfirmed. The whole scene, which was repeated to line roofing elements, showed two chariots racing to the right: leftmost was a single charioteer driving a biga, a two-horse chariot, with a dog running underneath the horses; rightmost was a single charioteer driving a triga, a three-horse chariot, with a hare running underneath the horses. This fragment shows a portion of the horses pulling the biga. The bar above the horse is the lower border of a pattern of concave tongues. It was made with what Patricia S. Lulof has described as “Mould 1” and “Mould 5a” in her reconstruction of the terracotta roofing elements.[1] This fragment was once part of a raking sima, the decorative edge of the gutter lining the slope of the roof.

Architectural terracottas made with the same molds were also used for several temple roofs in the city of Rome; these are called the “Rome-Caprifico decorative system” for roofs. They were likely products of a workshop (or related workshops) that also made terracotta roofing elements for temples that have been found at Rome, Velletri, and Veii. The Caprifico temple belongs to an uptick in public (including temple) building in central Italy (Latium and Etruria) in the final thirty years of the 6th century BCE and the first decades of the 5th century BCE. Some scholars have sought to connect this flurry of building and the iconography of the roof decorations to the expansionary activities of the last king of Rome, Tarquinius Superbus (traditional dates of reign: 534-509 BCE). 

According to Lulof’s reconstruction of the Caprifico roof’s elements, the pediment’s slopes were decorated with raking simas and revetment plaques, while the eaves were decorated with lateral simas, spouts, and antefixes, under which were additional revetment plaques. Four frieze scenes (mold 1: chariot race to the right; mold 2: riders to the left; mold 3: procession to the right; mold 4: procession to the left) used for the raking simas and accompanying revetment plaques; rows of concave tongues (molds 5a and 5b) were also used for raking simas, lateral simas (along the eaves), and revetment plaques; a frieze of a cross meander with stars and birds (mold 6) was used for revetment plaques; and lion-headed spouts (mold 7) and female-headed (mold 8) antefixes were used for the lateral simas.

Trade was the most common form of commerce in the ancient world. Amphorae (plural of amphora) were storage vessels used to transport goods in Roman times. They were used for wine, oil, and water. They were also used for garum, a type of fish sauce highly prized by the Romans. They varied in size, but the example in this collection is smaller than most amphorae. Pieces of amphorae are still found today at sites all over the Roman world. It is rare to find them fully intact, like this one, but they are often found whole in shipwrecks that would have been carrying liquids on trade routes. The saltwater and pressure below the surface help preserve artifacts, and in some cases, the liquid inside.

The special shape of the amphora makes it easy to stack them on top of each other and on their sides in the lower decks of a ship. They would have been corked on the top, like modern-day bottles of wine. The narrow bottom part of the amphora is called the toe. It was designed like this because it can easily stand up in dirt or sand, which was an early form of refrigeration. Digging a small hole in the ground and burying the amphora to its neck would help keep its contents cool.

Each strand of the braid is composed of three different colors (either red, light buff, and dark buff or light yellow, dark yellow, and dark buff), the lightest of which is always in the middle—creating an effect of shading and variety. Each strand has a dark outline that blends into the braid’s background.

The burial contained over thirty other vases, most of which are now held at the Museum of the University of Reading in England, although this is undoubtedly the most impressive. A number of metal objects were also associated with the tomb, at least some of which are now in the Provincial Archaeological Museum of Bari. See further:

The mythological scene depicted on this vase is closely paralleled in a roughly contemporary poem by the lyric poet Bacchylides (poem 17, especially lines 96-116). Bacchylides provides the wider context of Theseus’ visit to Poseidon, which comes about after king Minos of Crete – whose labyrinth held the Minotaur that Theseus famously slew – challenges Theseus to prove his divine parentage by diving into the ocean to retrieve a golden ring, and specifically reports that when Theseus came to Poseidon and his wife Amphitrite, she gave him a cloak and a wreath, just like as we see on this vase. It is possible that the round object that Theseus holds is supposed to be a box holding Minos’ ring, although this is apparently the only time that the vase painters ever attempted to represent this detail of the myth. 

Scholars have sometimes seen Bacchylides’ poem as influential on the depiction of this myth on this and similar vases, although it is not clear whether this vase or Bacchylides’ poem is earlier in date. At the very least  these cultural products are reflective of a general interest in this myth in the period. In any case, in light of the exposition of the myth by Bacchylides, we can understand this scene as a depiction of the moment when Theseus proved his divine heritage, enacted in the twin gestures of his handshake with Poseidon and Amphitrite holding the wreath over his head. 

Another reflection of Athenian interest in this myth is a mural by the painter Micon, which no longer exists, but which was described by the 2nd century C.E. travel writer Pausanias (1.17.3). This was located on the wall of the Theseion, a shrine to Theseus in Athens, which was likely renovated after Athens was sacked by the Persians in 479 B.C.E., and probably depicted a scene very similar to this one. Micon’s painting has also been thought of as a potential influence on the depiction of this and similar scenes on vases, although Barron has dismissed the possibility in his study of the murals of the Theseion, because of the different visual approach to the depiction of myth in the medium of wall painting.

This scene has clear political implications, in its depiction of an alliance between Theseus, the patron hero of Athens, and the god Poseidon. This vase also dates to soon after the end of the Persian Wars, a time in which the Athenians were establishing themselves as the leader of the Delian League of Greek cities, an arrangement which would soon develop into a de facto Athenian Empire. This divinising depiction of Theseus can be seen as part of a general Athenian tendency to elevate their most prominent local hero as they asserted their influence over the Greek world. 

The myth and corresponding scene type have some important similarities to Herakles’ introduction to Olympus and recognition as the son of Zeus, and is probably influenced by it. Herakles frequently acted as a model for the Athenians' enhancement of Theseus’ mythology, and compositional similarities between scenes depicting the two heroes in similar mythical contexts are unsurprising. In this case, see, for example, the strikingly similar overall composition used for Herakles meeting Zeus on a stamnos attributed to the Providence Painter (St. Petersburg B1559, BAPD 207407).

Most versions of this myth have simpler compositions with fewer figures, focussing on the central two (Theseus and Amphitrite: New York 53.11.4, BAPD 204406; Theseus and Poseidon: Yale 1913.143, BAPD 205603) or three characters (Copenhagen 2695, BAPD 203810; Paris, Cabinet des Medailles 418 BAPD 202956). It is more typical for Poseidon to be seated, rather than standing. There are also some examples of compositionally similar scenes depicting either Theseus meeting with his other mortal father Aegeus on his arrival at Athens, or farewelling his maternal grandfather Pittheus as he departs from Troizen (Paris G195, BAPD 204072; London E264, BAPD 206694; private collection, BAPD 9028595).",Red-figure,"On one side: the Athenian hero Theseus visits his divine father Poseidon. Theseus’s mother was Aethra, and ancient sources sometimes consider him to be the son of her husband, Aegeus, but sometimes also make him the son of Poseidon.

Poseidon stands at the center of the scene facing towards the right, identifiable by the trident he holds in his left hand, which is so tall that it overlaps the frieze above the scene. He wears a fillet on his head and a cloak (himation) over a long dotted tunic with drapery painted in dilute glaze. He is bearded with long hair. With his right hand he grasps Theseus’s right hand in greeting. 

Theseus stands facing towards the left, towards Poseidon. He wears a short tunic (chitoniskos) and a fringed shawl over his arms, and a wreath on his head. His legs are exposed with the musculature painted with dilute glaze. He carries a sword in its scabbard, and in his left hand he holds a small round object. He is clean-shaven with short hair tied into a bun and wears a wreath on his head. 

Behind Theseus is a female figure, at the right of the scene, who can be identified as Amphitrite, the wife of Poseidon. She faces to the left, towards Theseus and Poseidon. She wears a cloak (himation) over a long tunic (chiton), a fillet in her hair, and round dangling earrings. Her right hand is raised and holds up a wreath to crown Theseus, which was painted in added red but is now barely visible.

Behind Poseidon, on the left side of the scene, are two more figures who can be identified as the sea god Nereus and one of his daughters, the Nereids. Between the pair there is a doric column, which indicates that this scene is taking place indoors, presumably in Poseidon’s palace.

The Nereid stands at the far left, facing towards the right. She holds a black wine jug (oinochoe) in her right hand and a libation bowl (phiale) in her left, which is held at an angle to pour a libation. She wears a long, decorated dress (peplos) and cloak (himation), a hat and fillet in her hair, and black, dangling earrings. 

Between the Nereid and Poseidon is Nereus, who stands facing the right, towards Poseidon, but with his head turned back towards the Nereid. He wears a tunic (chiton) and a bordered cloak (himation) and leans on a tall staff with his left hand. His hair and beard are cropped short, and rendered in dilute glaze.

On the other side: a musician plays a kithara (lyre) among a group of other men. At the left of the scene a young, beardless man wearing a cloak (himation) stands facing towards the right, with his right hand raised towards a bearded man. 

This man stands facing the right but looks back at the young man. He also wears a cloak (himation) which obscures his arms, and holds a staff in his right hand.

In front of him stands another beardless youth who is playing the kithara (lyre). He wears a long garment with a black fringe and a fillet in his hair. His costume suggests that he may be playing the kithara in a competitive, festival context. He holds the large instrument, which intrudes on the frieze at the top of the scene, with his left hand, and his right hand is extended, holding a plectrum, which suggests that he has just plucked the strings. His mouth is slightly ajar, suggesting that he may be singing.

In front of the musician, on the right edge of the scene, stands another youth wearing a cloak (himation). He holds a forked staff (rhabdos), which probably indicates he is either a judge or a trainer of the musician.

A similar scene of musicians decorates another column krater by the Harrow Painter in a private collection and last put on the market by Sotheby’s New York in 1982 (BAPD 234).

Both scenes are framed by friezes of ivy-vines on the sides, black tongues at the top, and a simple reserved orange ground-line. The side of the top rim is decorated with horizontal palmettes on the Theseus side of the vase, and ivy vines on the musician side. The top of the rim is decorated with lotus buds, with elaborate single palmettes on each side where the handles are attached.

Also notable is an unattributed amphora (Louvre F236, BAPD 10739) which depicts a very similar composition with the addition of the figure of Athena standing behind Heracles; there are no published images of the other side, but it seems to depict, like the Harvard vase, the farewell of a hoplite, this time accompanied by a dog. An extensive catalog of nearly one-hundred depictions of Heracles and the Erymanthian boar on Greek vases was compiled by Stephen Bleecker Luce; however, this is an incomplete list, and the Harvard vase is not included. See:

Luce, Stephen Bleecker, “Studies of the Exploits of Heracles on Vases,” American Journal of Archaeology 28, no. 3 (1924): 296-325.

The Acheloos Painter’s name vase (Berlin 1851, BAPD 302396) features similar compositions to the Harvard amphora on both sides: on one side Heracles wrestles the centaur Acheloos, with Hermes looking on, although from behind rather than in front as on the Harvard vase; the other side depicts a near identical farewell of a hoplite and Scythian, with a leg-shaped device on the warrior’s shield, with the main differences being the addition of a dog at the feet of the warriors and a reversal of the woman and old man’s positions. Erik Holmberg has suggested that the Acheloos Painter’s farewell scenes, as exemplified by these two vases, were influential on other painters in the Leagros Group, and especially the Painter of Oxford 569, who painted four versions of the scene type. In particular, a neck-amphora attributed to the Painter of Oxford 569 and said to be in Rome in the collection of Schwarzenberg (BAPD 302180) bears a nearly identical scene to the Harvard vase, and might be directly influenced by it or a sketch of it. On this, and in general on the work and style of the Acheloos Painter, and his associations with other painters, particularly the so-called Leagros Group, see:

Erik J. Holmberg, The Red-line Painter and the workshop of the Acheloos Painter, Paul Åströms Förlag (Jonsered, 1990), 85-103, esp. 85-91.

Traditionally, the kind of costume that the archer wears on this vase has been taken to identify a figure as non-Greek, and in particular as Scythian. This is the assumption of Lissarague’s extended study of these figures in Greek vase painting, in which he argues that the archer, when paired with a hoplite, as on this vase, acts as a subservient companion who serves to emphasise the epic heroism of the hoplite. 

More recently, Ivantchik has suggested that it is a misinterpretation to understand these figures as “Scythians” and that in archaic Greek art this kind of costume should merely be taken to indicate that the figure is an archer. Mythological archers – including Paris, Parthenopaeus (one of the Seven Against Thebes) and Heracles – are often shown wearing this kind of costume. Eventually, in the classical period, after the Persian invasion of 480-479 B.C., this iconography does come to represent foreignness and is commonly used for depictions of Persians. See further:

The Erymanthian boar was a monster which plagued the central Peloponnese around Mt. Erymanthos, and it was one of Herakles’ labours to catch it. Herakles is identifiable especially by his characteristic lion skin (which he wears over a tunic (chiton)) and club, and is also equipped with a quiver and a sword in its scabbard. He stands facing right in mid-step at the back of the boar, and partly obscured by it, grasping the top of its head with his left hand and holding his club over it with his right. His lion skin is decorated with small incised double lines representing the fur, added red dots on its mane, and its teeth and claws are painted in added white. Herakles’ beard is also dotted with added red. 

The boar occupies the center of the composition, facing to the right with its forelegs raised, and with added red dots on its neck, and with finely incised hair bristles along its back and tail. At the right, in front of the boar and facing left is the god Hermes, identifiable by his traveller’s cap (petasos), winged shoes and short cloak (chlamys). His cloak is decorated with a few dots in added red and white. His beard and his hat are also decorated with added red. His hair is tied into a bun. He reaches his left hand over the boar’s neck and behind Herakles’ arm, and holds his right hand up to his hat. In the background is a tree which is bearing white fruit. 

On the other side: the farewell of a warrior? At the center of the scene are two figures standing side-by-side facing left behind a round shield. The figure in the front is the warrior who carries the shield, which is decorated with a leg-shaped device in added white, and has its rim colored in added red. He is wearing greaves and a Corinthian helmet, which interrupts the tongue frieze at the top of the body of the vase. He also seems to carry two spears. The other figure stands looking back over his shoulder to the right, carrying a quiver, visible below the shield, and which identifies him as an archer. He also wears a pointed cap which may suggest that he is a Scythian or other foreigner. 

The two figures face an old man with hair and beard in added white at the left of the scene. He carries a scepter and wears a long cloak (himation) which is decorated with added red and white. He may be the father of one of the warriors. To the right, behind the warriors, is a woman, wearing a long cloak, with similar decoration to that of the old man. Her skin is colored with added white and she wears a red fillet in her hair. Both of her arms are covered by her cloak and she lifts her right hand to her face, as if wiping away tears.

The sides of the neck are decorated with a lotus and palmette chain, a band of red and black tongues decorates the top of the shoulder, and below the ground line, which is a single black line, there is a band of lotus framed by double lines, while below this, above the foot, there is a band of rays.

At the left of the scene two frontal-facing gorgons with grotesque faces, wings, snakes on their heads and winged shoes run to the right, in pursuit of the hero Perseus, who is depicted running at the right edge of the frieze. 

Perseus wears a cap, a red and black tunic (chiton), winged shoes, and a sword strapped over his chest. Underneath his feet there is a bearded snake. On the skirt of his tunic there is a large rosette, which is very similar to the rosettes which adorn the tunic of the gorgon on the left. 

The two gorgons have identical poses and both wear red and black tunics (chitons) with very different decoration. The monsters’ skin is painted with added white, signaling their female gender, and their wings and tongues are red. 

Between Perseus and the gorgon there are two additional figures, one male and one female, standing rather than running. These can be understood as the divine protectors of Perseus. The male figure on the left is Hermes, bearded and wearing a red cloak (himation), identifiable by his staff (caduceus). The female figure on the right is presumably Athena, although there is no iconography that explicitly identifies her, because she is regularly included in depictions of this myth; she wears a black cloak with rosette decorations over a red tunic (chiton) and her skin is painted in added white. 

On the body: in a symmetrical composition, two warriors engage in combat, watched by two other men on horseback. The two warriors face each other at the center of the composition with raised spears; the figure on the left wears a black low-crested helmet, a white breast-plate with incised decoration, a red baldric over his chest, and red greaves. He also carries a large shield in his left hand, of which the reverse side is visible, red with a black border dotted with white. 

His opponent on the right holds his shield towards the viewer, which is black with a red border, and a white tripod insignia. He wears a red helmet with its crest painted in white, black greaves and a short tunic (chiton). Behind each figure is a horse with a rider pulling back on the reins. The riders wear white tunics and have red hair and beards; the horses’ manes are also red. 

Two red and black birds (probably eagles) are depicted between the feet of the two warriors, and over the back of the horse on the right. The tops of the figures’ heads and helmets spill over into the frieze on the shoulder.

Some scholars have identified this site with the ancient city of Pometia, but this identification remains unconfirmed. 

The whole scene, which was repeated to line the edge of roofing elements, showed three pairs of armed riders running to the left, with (from left to right) a hare, a dog, and a deer underneath the horses, made with what Patricia S. Lulof has described as “Mould 2” in her reconstruction of the terracotta roofing elements.[1] This fragment comes from the third pair of riders (rightmost in the scene). According to Lulof’s reconstruction, it belonged to either a revetment plaque (more likely) or a raking sima; if the latter, it would have been used for the right slope of the pediment.

Architectural terracottas made with the same molds were also used for several temple roofs in the city of Rome; these are called the “Rome-Caprifico decorative system” for roofs. They were likely products of a workshop (or related workshops) that also made terracotta roofing elements for temples that have been found at Rome, Velletri, and Veii. The Caprifico temple belongs to an uptick in public (including temple) building in central Italy (Latium and Etruria) in the final thirty years of the 6th century BCE and the first decades of the 5th century BCE. Some scholars have sought to connect this flurry of building and the iconography of the roof decorations to the expansionary activities of the last king of Rome, Tarquinius Superbus (traditional dates of reign: 534-509 BCE). 

According to Lulof’s reconstruction of the Caprifico roof’s elements, the pediment’s slopes were decorated with raking simas and revetment plaques, while the eaves were decorated with lateral simas, spouts, and antefixes, under which were additional revetment plaques. Four frieze scenes (mold 1: chariot race to the right; mold 2: riders to the left; mold 3: procession to the right; mold 4: procession to the left) used for the raking simas and accompanying revetment plaques; rows of concave tongues (molds 5a and 5b) were also used for raking simas, lateral simas (along the eaves), and revetment plaques; a frieze of a cross meander with stars and birds (mold 6) was used for revetment plaques; and lion-headed spouts (mold 7) and female-headed (mold 8) antefixes were used for the lateral simas.

That this fragment belongs to the Caprifico roof was confirmed in 1977, when this fragment (1976.6) was found to join with a cast made from a fragment that was, at that time, in the collection of the Ashmolean Museum (Oxford). The original fragment is now in the collection of the Museo della Città e del Territorio di Cori, Italy (Inv. No. 1973.306).

The second, further-away horse is “behind”—i.e., to the right, of the frontmost horse; the second rider is “in front” of the frontmost rider—i.e., to the left.

The frontmost rider holds a round shield in front of his body. He wears a helmet with large cheek pieces and an upward projecting element on the front; the top of the helmet is not fully preserved. His left arm, wearing a short sleeve, projects behind him; it is broken at or before the elbow. He wears greaves (which are worn and difficult to ascertain). His heel is preserved but his foot is otherwise broken off. The broken edge of the fragment runs from under the round shield to the rider’s heel. 

The second rider wears a helmet or a cap (broken off at top); it is not easy to discern a cheek piece on the fragment (though other examples of this scene suggest that he wears a helmet with a cheekpiece). 

The frontmost horse’s ears stand up, as does its hogged mane. The horse’s bridle is visible only faintly. Also faintly visible are reins (as a thin molded line) that run from the horse’s head (the forepart of which is lost at the break), across its neck, to behind the rider’s shield.

To the right of the horse’s mane, a right hand holds a linear element; comparison with other examples from this mold indicates that this element is a whip. This hand may belong to the second (further-away) rider.",Terracotta,Fragment of architectural frieze plaque: armed riders (from frieze depicting procession of armed riders),Gift,"Caprifico di Torrecchia, near Cisterna di Latina, Italy.

On many of the other similar textiles the women clearly wear a diadem and have haloes, instead of the more ambiguous headdress studded with pearls on this textile.","Woven, tapestry weave","This fragmentary tapestry-woven textile depicts five female busts representing well dressed woman interspersed with stylized pink and green palmettes. The exact orientation of these heads is uncertain, but this was most likely a hanging depicting a secular theme and hung in a domestic space. All the women are dark-haired and wear headdresses topped with crowns; what are either veils or haloes are covered in large round pearls. Though the busts may appear identical at first glance, they are marked by subtle variations in eye color, expression, and details of tunics and jewelry. All of their elaborate robes vary in decoration—some are woven with flower patterns, others are studded with jewels. Each woman registers a somewhat different expression. The most prominent feature of the faces is the eyes, with arched brows. Four of the women look to their left, while the rightmost returns their gaze. In the four women who look to the right, eye color alternates between blue and brown.

This pattern of female busts alternating with flowers seems to have been a common decorative trope in Byzantine interior spaces in Egypt and is attested in several media including architectural friezes. Such luxuriously dressed women may represent general ideas of prosperity, luxury, or feminine beauty. Their appearance is reminiscent of the (typically female) personifications of natural elements or beneficent concepts common to Late Antique art, such as the seasons, Earth, Renewal, and Enjoyment. In this particular textile, they may also represent tyche figures or empresses because of their turreted crowns.

Following the initial three letters is most likely the name Sarapion (CAΡAΠIWN). The inscription that is the more complete of the two ends in the letters ΘΕȢΝ.

Mosaics were most often installed on the floors of Roman houses to decorate them and make the owners appear wealthy. Early mosaics used simple pebbles, usually in black and white, to create designs. They evolved to incorporate cut stone tiles, known as tesserae, which existed in a wide variety of colors. Simple geometric patterns gave way to elaborate scenes with mythological figures, animals, ships, and everyday life.

There are five main types of mosaic work, all with Latin names. The first is ""opus regulatum,"" the most basic type in which the tesserae are laid down in a grid pattern, all aligning vertically and horizontally. The second type is ""opus tessellatum."" In this type, the tesserae are laid in vertical or horizontal rows, but not both. This is one of the most common types and is often used for the background of scenes. The next type, ""opus vermiculatum,"" is also very common. It is named ""vermiculatum"" because the rows of tesserae resemble ""worms."" They curve around figures and details, making this one of the most difficult types of mosaic to execute. When vermiculatum is combined with tessellatum, usually with tessellatum work creating the background for a central image, the whole piece is called ""opus classicum."" The last main type of mosaic work is ""opus sectile,"" where one large tessera (cut stone) forms the entire shape. For example, a large star may be cut out of stone and laid into a mosaic, with smaller tesserae forming the rows of background color.   

[Jessica Pesce 8/12/10]",,"Rectangular slab of Roman mortar and tesserae (small cut stones). The mortar is thin, and the tesserae are approximately 2 cm deep. On the flat surface, which is polished and even, the tesserae are 1 cm square. There is a short row of white tesserae, below which there is a single row of red tesserae. Below that there are two rows of gray tesserae, followed by four rows of white tesserae. Below the white is a row of black tesserae with three black tesserae forming a ""v"" shape below the horizontal line.

Funerary inscriptions were very common in the ancient world. They would most often be seen outside the city walls, since burials in Rome were restricted to outside the city. They were carved in stone using all capital letters. Funerary inscriptions were often multiple lines long and contained numerous details about the deceased's life. It would list their age at the time of death, parentage, family connections, and sometimes even profession. It would often send the deceased off on their trip to the ""diis manibus,"" or the ""spirits of the dead."" 

Some funerary dedications are more elaborate than others, depending on the class of the deceased. Many tombs would feature a depiction of the person, either just a bust or sometimes even a full statue. The inscription could contain terms of endearment, such as ""dedicated by her beloved husband."" These dedications help paint a picture of Roman family life and the culture's view on death. We are also able to see the development of the Latin language and alphabet through the evolution of these inscriptions.

Thin crack from right-of-center bottom to middle of fourth row of inscription. Portion of concrete attached to back when brought to museum; this was determined to be modern. Modern paint spots on surface and some rust spots. Rectangular shaped slab of marble of even thickness. The front is framed with a border roughly 2.5 cm. wide, comprised of a flat surface, a groove, a curve with a raised border, and a deep groove bordering the inscription. The first four lines are aligned close to the left frame; the fifth line in inset at both ends. The bottom line is begun slightly closer to the left frame than the other lines. The last is the longest line, measuring 27 cm. The letters are capitals of an average height of 1.7 cm. tall and 1.5 cm. wide. In the second line, the inscriber ran out of space and put the final ""us"" of ""medicus"" in small letters. He also made the final ""s"" of ""suis"" as a smaller letter. 

Found in situ at the tomb of Caecilia Metella in a huge necropolis northwest of the Porta Salaria and Piazza Fiume in Rome (near present-day Via Po). The necropolis, containing tombs of members of leading Roman families, is dated from the end of the Republican period to early Augustan times.

Translation by Professor Mason Hammond in 1980:
            Quintus Caecilius Hilarus, a doctor, 
            Freedman of Caecilia, wife of Crassus. 
            Caecilia Eleutheris, freedwoman of 
            two Scriboniae. With the share of a half. 
            For himself (themselves?) and their (family).

OR      ""With half (of this columbarium) for themselves and their family."" 
                        
Caecilius Hilarus was a physician of the famous Caecilia Metella. Her circular tomb is still seen as a large monument on the Appian Way south of Rome. The doctor's praenomen Quintus was taken from the name of Caecilia Metella's father. Caecilia Eleutheris was Hilarus' wife. She was the freedwoman of the two ""Scriboniae,"" one of whom was the first wife of Augustus (40-39 BCE) and mother of his only child, Julia. The other sister was married to the son of Pompey the Great, Sextus Pompeius, who was defeated by Augustus/Octavian in 36 BCE. 

This inscription was most likely acquired in Rome in 1906-7 by Professor Harry L. Wilson, a member of the Department of Classics at Johns Hopkins University. It was then mounted on a chimney breast in a house in Baltimore owned by Professor Wilson from 1908 until his death in 1913. The house was purchased by the family of Hugh Pagon in 1920, with the inscription still attached to the chimney. Hugh Pagon gave the inscription to Harvard in 1980 in memory of his family members who attended Harvard.  

This piece was originally thought to be part of Professor David Robinson's collection of objects brought back from Antioch in Pisidia. However, later evidence proved this theory incorrect, as his excavation there took place in the summer of 1924, when the object was already in Baltimore. 

In March, 1981 the cement on the back of the plaque was tested by E. Farrell and R. Newman to determine its age. They concluded that material most resembles modern Portland cement. If it were Roman mortar, the Fe would have formed rust and stained both the cement and plaque.

However, at least two—and perhaps all three—of the fragments were not original to each other. This composite or “pastiche” object has been disassembled and the fragments are now accessioned individually, as 1992.256.12.1 (head), 1992.256.12.2 (body), and 1992.256.12.3 (legs). The terracotta (clay) fabric of the legs (1992.256.12.3) differs from that of the head (1992.256.12.1) and body (1992.256.12.2): this is clear from X-radiography, which indicated that the materials were different (e.g., different density and inclusions). It is less clear whether the terracotta fabric of the head and body differ from each other; X-radiography suggested that the head may have been formed in a slightly different way than the manner in which the body was made, but the evidence is not conclusive.

Several scenarios are possible: (1) the fragments are from two or three different ancient figurines (a “pastiche” of ancient fragments); (2) one or two fragments (such as the legs) were made in the 20th century to complete the other fragment(s), which, in this scenario, would likely be authentically ancient, creating a mixed modern and ancient “pastiche”; (3) all fragments are modern.

When the pastiche figurine was disassembled and old fills were removed, it became clear that the breaks do not align tightly. However, the edges of the breaks at the neck and legs all seem to be clean, modern cuts; it is possible that broken edges were cleaned up to facilitate easier mending when it was assembled.

These figurine fragments are fairly typical examples of a category of figurines depicting a nude female figure with a “bird-like” face. These were made in the 2nd millennium BCE at sites across northern Syria (today’s eastern Turkey and northern Syria). Specifically, this figurine takes a form that comes from the region of the Orontes River. Such figurines are often interpreted as goddesses or divinities; the frequent depiction of breasts (not present here) and pubic triangles (present here) have encouraged interpretations of deities or domains of life pertaining to female sexuality and/or fertility. It is common for figurines of this type to be broken across the legs. It is not currently clear if this frequent breakage pattern is the result of intentional, perhaps ritual, breakage or merely indicates a common susceptibility of the figurines to breakage during use or deposition.

Further information on this type of figurine may be found in the following standard reference work (where it falls into the category of Orontes Type MAI 2): Leila Badre. 1980.

These figurines—with their curious faces (sometimes deemed “bird-like”), elaborate headdresses, and emphatic hips—are puzzling. Examples like numbers 1–4 [1998.15.16; 1992.256.12.1–3; 2022.242.1–3; 1969.177.86.1–2] have been found across today’s northern Syria and southeastern Türkiye (Turkey) in sanctuaries and graves dating from the second millennium BCE. Their applied breasts and incised pubic triangles mark them as female, encouraging modern interpretations about fertility and sexuality. Number 5 [1953.118], likely made on the island of Cyprus, shows similar features, attesting to ideas about female bodies shared between distant but connected communities of the eastern Mediterranean and western Asia during the Bronze Age. 
Who exactly do they depict? Goddesses or worshippers? Both or neither? Any answers are complicated by wrinkles in their modern stories that raise a more urgent question: are these objects even ancient? 
All six figurines moved through the art market without documented findspots, making it difficult to interpret them or even assess their authenticity. Number 6 [1999.252] may be a modern forgery. And while numbers 2–4 [1992.256.12.1–3; 2022.242.1–3; 1969.177.86.1–2] arrived at Harvard as single objects, each, in fact, comprises several pieces that are not original to each other. It is not clear whether the fragments are all ancient, all modern, or a combination of both.

The trio is frontal, standing on a base and against a rectangular plaque backing. The left leg of each figure strides forward slightly. Represented partially in the round, all three figures are depicted with rounded stomachs and articulated belly-buttons. 

On the left, Isis wears a headdress in the form of a throne, recognizable by its stepped appearance. This crown is a representation of Isis’ name in hieroglyphs. Horus stands at the center. When Horus is depicted as a child, he is often referred to by the Greek name “Harpokrates” or “Harpocrates,” which is derived from phonetically from the ancient Egyptian phrase meaning “Horus-the-child.” While he is the same size as the adult goddesses on either side of him, his status as a child is indicated by his lock of hair on the right side of his head (often called the “sidelock of youth”). Horus is the son of Isis and Osiris. On the right, Nephthys wears a headdress of a temple topped by a basket, a representation of her name in hieroglyphs, visible here in the way the headdress bulges out at top.

Unlike other Athenian pottery, which was regularly produced for export across the Mediterranean, and especially to Italy, white-ground lekythoi are only rarely found outside of Attica, the region surrounding Athens.

The white-ground decorative technique produces decoration which is much less stable than the red-figure or black-figure technique and is mostly used for vessels with funerary or ritual functions that do not demand heavy use. White ground lekythoi regularly feature decoration only on the front of the vessel, with the back left blank, and even decorative friezes extending only halfway around the vessel.

This type of vase was in common production from around 480 B.C.E. until towards the end of the fifth century. Its popularity in this period may be related to the absence of any private gravestones in Attica from around 490-80 to 430 B.C.E. Exactly why the Athenians stopped producing gravestones for half a century is not entirely clear, but the white-ground lekythos might be thought of as replicating some of the ritual and commemorative functions of a gravestone. A great many examples feature a representation of a grave monument.

These vases were designed to hold oil and seem to have been used in a number of different ways in funerary ritual: burned with the body in cremations, for pouring oil libations on the body or the grave site, and as offerings left at or in a burial. The great majority have been found in and around graves. 

Accordingly, their painted decoration usually features scenes connected with funerary ritual or the mythology of the afterlife, and can give us some insight into ancient Athenian funerary practices and ideas about death. This scene probably shows a visit to the grave by the family of the deceased. Sometimes scenes of this kind will include a figure who seems to represent the dead individual, but it is often not possible to make identifications like this with any certainty.

Artificial lighting in the Roman Empire was accomplished with torches, candles and lamps. Torches were used outdoors, while candles made of wax were used mainly in areas that did not have olive oil. Lamps were the most common means of light, used all over the Empire, but especially where oil was produced or imported. 

Lamps range from decorative to functional, though all utilize the same basic features. The oil chamber inside holds the fuel, while the hole at the top is for filling. There is usually a nozzle and a wick-hole for wicks that were made of fibrous materials, most often linen. Lamps themselves could be made in bronze, lead, iron, gold, silver, glass, or stone. However, the most common construction material for lamps was pottery. Though they could be made by hand or on a potter's wheel, they were most often constructed in molds. 

First, the maker would construct a clay archetype of the lamp that would be solid, not hollow. Then a plaster mold would be made of the archetype. The mold would often be two parts, an upper and lower part, that wet clay could be pressed into to make a new lamp. When the clay was leather-hard, additional decorations, stamps, or handles could be added, and the wick and filling holes were pierced. A coat of slip was put on before the lamp would be fired in a kiln. 

Lamps were distributed both by local workshops and by export from specialty workshops. There is some archaeological evidence for specific names of workshops and their trade routes, but still much is unknown about these factories. Sometimes makers left marks on the bottom of their lamps, which can help archaeologists in determining where the lamp was originally from.

This lamp is decorated with a gladiator's figure instead of simple patterns, as with some other lamps in this collectoin. This shows the importance of gladiators in Roman everyday life; the image is recognizable and significant enough to take time inscribing on an object as ordinary as a lamp.

Pieces of brick were used to face concrete walls, and stamps such as this one therefore serve to date the construction of buildings.

Though the Greeks were known to stamp tiles, most of the evidence for the rise of Roman stamps comes from the third century BCE.

Amphorae handles were often stamped with the name of the family or company that shipped the goods inside. The stamp on this handle is of the Melissi family. Handles with their stamp have been found in numerous places in the western part of the Roman Empire, particularly Spain, suggesting that they were one of the wealthiest families in that area. It is believed that the company was owned by either a husband and wife or a brother and sister, since there is both a masculine and feminine form of the name on some of these stamps. The height of production for this firm was the first half of the second century CE, and it was ultimately passed to L. Iunius Melissus, their descendant.

Most brick stamps were rectangular and made of bronze. The letters were often in all capitals, cast in raised relief. Stamps were used for marking a wide variety of materials, such as bricks, amphorae, tiles, lamps, and other ceramic vessels. Sometimes even bread was stamped. Though the Greeks were known to stamp tiles, most of the evidence for the rise of Roman stamps comes from the third century BCE.

The stamp would usually name the maker or exporter of the product, as seen with the COSSINI EVTVCHIANI stamp in this collection. The name of the person is in the genitive case to show possession. This stamped amphora handle would have been made in the same way. The Arretine bowl in this collection has a different kind of stamp: a small foot in the center. This could be a trademark of a certain factory, and it would be of particular help to people who could not read.

[J.Pesce 8/4/10]

The amphora stamps of the Melissi family are found all over the western Mediterranean, in such frequency and extent as to suggest that they must have been one of the wealthiest and most productive families in Spain. The stamps of the ""Two Iunii Melissi"", giving forms of the names Melissus and Melissa, belonged to a firm owned by a husband and wife, or a brother and sister. They appear to have operated the firm in the first half of the second century CE. Around the end of the reign of Antoninus Pius, the business appears to have passed to L. Iunius Melissus, who was probably the son of both or one of them. The museum has an example of his stamps (1977.216.154).",Terracotta,Stamped Amphora Handle,Transfer,"Probably acquired by Henry W.

Mosaics were most often installed on the floors of Roman houses to decorate them and make the owners appear wealthy. Early mosaics used simple pebbles, usually in black and white, to create designs. They evolved to incorporate cut stone tiles, known as tesserae, which existed in a wide variety of colors. Simple geometric patterns gave way to elaborate scenes with mythological figures, animals, ships, and everyday life.

There are five main types of mosaic work, all with Latin names. The first is ""opus regulatum,"" the most basic type in which the tesserae are laid down in a grid pattern, all aligning vertically and horizontally. The second type is ""opus tessellatum."" In this type, the tesserae are laid in vertical or horizontal rows, but not both. This is one of the most common types and is often used for the background of scenes. The next type, ""opus vermiculatum,"" is also very common. It is named ""vermiculatum"" because the rows of tesserae resemble ""worms."" They curve around figures and details, making this one of the most difficult types of mosaic to execute. When vermiculatum is combined with tessellatum, usually with tessellatum work creating the background for a central image, the whole piece is called ""opus classicum."" The last main type of mosaic work is ""opus sectile,"" where one large tessera (cut stone) forms the entire shape. For example, a large star may be cut out of stone and laid into a mosaic, with smaller tesserae forming the rows of background color.   

[Jessica Pesce 8/12/10]",,"Mosaic fragment approximately 3 cm thick. The slab is comprised of mainly Roman mortar, with approximately .5 cm thick tesserae (cut stone tiles). On the flat, polished surface, the tesserae are .3 cm square. There is a black background with a white tendril curling upwards (opus vermiculatum). The beginning of another white tendril can be seen to the right side, but it is now broken off. It appears as if the white tendril was put in this area of the fragment first, because the tesserae of the black background curve around it. Above and below this area, there are straight black lines of the background (opus tesselatum), suggesting they were assembled even before the tendrils.

Earrings proliferated in the Hellenistic period and are often found preserved in tombs or as dedications in sanctuaries. Jewelry was worn in daily life, making a pair of earrings like these a fitting grave good to accompany the dead to provide them comfort in the afterlife.

These earrings were thought by archaeologist David M. Robinson to have been part of a hoard of jewelry and coins reportedly found at Halmyrus, Thessaly, northern Greece, in 1929 and distributed on the market [1].

New techniques, forms, and materials for jewelry were introduced to a the cosmopolitian elite of wealthier society that wanted fashionable, luxurious goods, especially in gold. Earrings proliferated in the Hellenistic period and are often found preserved in tombs or as dedications in sanctuaries. Jewelry was worn in daily life, making a pair of earrings like these a fitting grave good to accompany the dead to provide them comfort in the afterlife.

These earrings were thought by archaeologist David M. Robinson to have been part of a hoard of jewelry and coins reportedly found at Halmyrus, Thessaly, northern Greece, in 1929 and distributed on the market [1].

Other versions of this subject include Pelias watching the rejuvenation of the ram (such as the hydria London B328, BAPD 302037), and usually Medea is differentiated from the Peliades because she is holding a vessel, presumably containing some magic ingredient (as on the oinochoe Louvre F372, BAPD 330879), rather than the stick she carries here. A particularly close parallel is Kurashiki 31, BAPD 3494, like the Harvard vase a neck amphora attributed to the Leagros Group, where, however, the ram-boiling scene decorates only one side, and features three, rather than two, female figures.",Black-figure,"Both sides of this vase depict an episode from the story of Medea, the daughter of Aeetes, king of Colchis (in modern-day Georgia). When the Greek hero Jason came with the Argonauts to Colchis to get the Golden Fleece, Medea assisted them, and returned to Iolcus in Greece with Jason. Although King Pelias had promised to hand over the throne to Jason once he had retrieved the Fleece, he refused to do so. Medea devised a trick: she told Pelias’ daughters (the Peliades) that she could rejuvenate their elderly father, and proved this by boiling a ram in a cauldron and turning it into a lamb. The Peliades were convinced, and did the same thing to their father, killing him. 

This vase depicts the moment when Medea boiled the ram for the Peliades. The two sides of this vase are very similar, although we can identify one of the four female figures as Medea because of the object she is carrying.

On one side: Medea and one of the daughters of Pelias stand around a ram cooking in a cauldron. The woman on the left carries a short stick with a palmette-tip in her left hand, which is either a wand or an ingredient she is adding to the cauldron, and suggests that she is probably the sorceress Medea. Her right hand tugs at her skirt. She, like the other three women, wears a tunic (chiton) and a cloak (himation) decorated with white and red dots, and has long wavy hair and a red fillet worn around her head. She and the other women would have had their skin painted in added white; most of this now has been lost and the facial features of the women are no longer visible. 

Medea’s pose closely resembles a kore statue, a type of marble statue of a woman which was common in Athens at the time this vase was made, with a standardized pose holding up a fruit or other object in her left hand, while her right pulls at her skirt. 

Between the two figures is the cauldron (lebes), which sits on a tripod over a fire, which is depicted with strokes of added red coming from a pile of lumpy logs. The front half of the ram comes out of the top of the cauldron. It is clearly still a ram and not the rejuvenated lamb because of its horns, although these were painted in added white which has now mostly flaked off the vase. 

On the right is another woman, presumably a daughter of Pelias. Her back faces away from the viewer, and her cloak is draped over both of her shoulders, instead of just one like Medea. She seems to gesture at the ram in the cauldron with her left hand, perhaps remarking at the sorceress’ skill. There are vines trailing through the background of the scene.

On the other side: the composition is almost identical with the ram in the cauldron in the center, surrounded by two onlooking women. The woman on the left gestures towards the cauldron with her left hand and wears her cloak over her left shoulder. The woman on the right reaches out to touch the ram, and wears her cloak over both shoulders, and, somewhat unrealistically, draped over her chest too. These two women are presumably both daughters of Peleus. 

The sides of the neck are decorated with a lotus and palmette chain, a band of black tongues decorates the top of the shoulder, and below the ground line, which is a single black line, there is a band of lotus framed by double lines, while below this, above the foot, there is a band of rays. Below the handles, between the two figural scenes there is a symmetrical decorative pattern of palmettes with coiling tendrils and lotus.

On the bottom of the foot there is an incised trademark, XX.",Terracotta,Neck Amphora (storage jar): Medea Boiling a Ram,Bequest,,c. 520 BCE,Department of Ancient and Byzantine Art & Numismatics,-515,"[{'role': 'Artist', 'birthplace': None, 'gender': 'unknown', 'displaydate': 'active 530-520 BCE', 'prefix': 'Attributed to', 'culture': 'Greek', 'displayname': 'Attributed to The Leagros Group', 'alphasort': 'Leagros Group', 'name': 'The Leagros Group', 'personid': 21616, 'deathplace': None, 'displayorder': 1}]",https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/290713,6th century BCE,1960.315,,Greek,290713,42.5 cm h x 28.2 cm diam.

Beazley (1885-1970) as the “Negro Alabastra Group” which all depict an image of a black warrior standing alone. The oil flask (alabastron) is typically considered to be a feminine object for feminine usage and is thought to have held scented perfumes or other similar kinds of substances. The shape and white-ground background are where it gets its name, the latter is believed to have been imitate the appearance of alabaster, out of which more expensive alabastra would have been made. 

Scholars have debated on how to interpret the images of black warriors on such vessels: are they intended to represent a particular group of black warriors, like the warriors of Memnon from the Iliad? Are they a reference to black warriors fighting for the Persians as described by Herodotus? Though both of these hypotheses are possible, especially the latter considering the time period (early fifth century BCE.) in which they were made. However, it cannot be said for sure since the visual evidence of any specific contexts is lacking on the actual vessels.

 Another issue of interpretation is what these images have to do with the vessels on which they are painted. The warriors are often juxtaposed with images of a palm tree, as here, or of an Amazon, a female warrior generally connoted as foreign and non-Greek. One line of interpretation is that the images are intended to evoke a sense of exoticism, possibly referencing the far-off places from which the vessel’s contents - likely perfume - originated. Even if latter association is somewhat questionable, it is true that the images generally portray the “other.” Building on this reading is the fact that these vessels never depict the ideal Greek male citizen either as a hoplite (citizen warrior) or otherwise. Thus, as François Lissarrague argues, the feminine vessels coupled with the exotic imagery are intended to represent the realm of “the other,” which in Classical Greek society meant women and foreigners.

Unlike other Athenian pottery, which was regularly produced for export across the Mediterranean, and especially to Italy, white-ground lekythoi are only rarely found outside of Attica, the region surrounding Athens.

The white-ground decorative technique produces decoration which is much less stable than the red-figure or black-figure technique and is mostly used for vessels with funerary or ritual functions that do not demand heavy use. White ground lekythoi regularly feature decoration only on the front of the vessel, with the back left blank, and even decorative friezes extending only halfway around the vessel.

This type of vase was in common production from around 480 B.C.E. until towards the end of the fifth century. Its popularity in this period may be related to the absence of any private gravestones in Attica from around 490-80 to 430 B.C.E. Exactly why the Athenians stopped producing gravestones for half a century is not entirely clear, but the white-ground lekythos might be thought of as replicating some of the ritual and commemorative functions of a gravestone. A great many examples feature a representation of a grave monument.

These vases were designed to hold oil and seem to have been used in a number of different ways in funerary ritual: burned with the body in cremations, for pouring oil libations on the body or the grave site, and as offerings left at or in a burial. The great majority have been found in and around graves. 

Accordingly, their painted decoration usually features scenes connected with funerary ritual or the mythology of the afterlife, and can give us some insight into ancient Athenian funerary practices and ideas about death. This vase illustrates a central Greek belief about the afterlife, that the ferryman Charon would escort the souls of the dead over the river Styx to the underworld.

This vase, along with another lekythos in Berlin (F2683, BAPD 9022338), has been the subject of a chemical analysis of its purple-red pigmentation. This has demonstrated that the color results from a chemical reaction between a copper-based blue pigment and the white-ground slip, which was probably caused by exposure to fire. The analysis suggests that the vase was most likely ritually burned together with the body of the deceased during the process of cremation. The pattern of the coloration suggests that the vase was probably broken before being put onto the fire.

Weaving in the ancient world was the primary duty of women. It was one of the main ways in which a household could be self-sufficient. Women wove clothing, cushions and covers for wooden furniture, and wall coverings. Wool was the most common material used, followed by linen. If a family had its own sheep, they could produce their own wool. However, flax and linen had to be imported from elsewhere when there was a lack of fertile land. Silk and cotton were both rare materials and were not often used for clothing.

To prepare wool for weaving, it had to be cleaned and dyed with mineral or vegetable compounds. The wool was then spun with a distaff and spindle, preparing the yarn. Yarn was woven into other threads hanging from the top of the loom with weights at the bottom to keep them taut. This is called a warp-weighted loom and was very popular in ancient Greece, as seen on numerous red and black figure vases.

Herms were also thought to be protective (boundaries tend to be dangerous places after all); a small version such as this example would have likely served an apotropaic purpose. 

Part of what makes herms ""work"" is that they always have worked. Because of this, they tend to look similar regardless of when they were made or what the prevalent artistic styles were at the time. This can make small terracotta herms, especially, difficult to date. Our example is signed, and that might offer some clues: broken bar alphas begin to be used in the Hellenistic period, but appear later as well.

Unlike other Athenian pottery, which was regularly produced for export across the Mediterranean, and especially to Italy, white-ground lekythoi are only rarely found outside of Attica, the region surrounding Athens.

The white-ground decorative technique produces decoration which is much less stable than the red-figure or black-figure technique and is mostly used for vessels with funerary or ritual functions that do not demand heavy use. White ground lekythoi regularly feature decoration only on the front of the vessel, with the back left blank, and even decorative friezes extending only halfway around the vessel.

This type of vase was in common production from around 480 B.C.E. until towards the end of the fifth century. Its popularity in this period may be related to the absence of any private gravestones in Attica from around 490-80 to 430 B.C.E. Exactly why the Athenians stopped producing gravestones for half a century is not entirely clear, but the white-ground lekythos might be thought of as replicating some of the ritual and commemorative functions of a gravestone. A great many examples feature a representation of a grave monument.

These vases were designed to hold oil and seem to have been used in a number of different ways in funerary ritual: burned with the body in cremations, for pouring oil libations on the body or the grave site, and as offerings left at or in a burial. The great majority have been found in and around graves. 

Accordingly, their painted decoration usually features scenes connected with funerary ritual or the mythology of the afterlife, and can give us some insight into ancient Athenian funerary practices and ideas about death. This scene shows a visit to the grave by the family of the deceased. Sometimes scenes of this kind will include a figure who seems to represent the dead individual, but it is often not possible to make identifications like this with any certainty. The presence of a child on this vase is an uncommon feature.

See Trendall and McPhee 1987, 111, no. 58.  

Trendall and McPhee (1987, 56) argue the likelihood that fish plates were used to serve fish, and that some may have had a solely funerary function. The scholars focus on the small depression in the center of these plates, indicating that such depressions were likely meant to catch fish juices or the oil in which the fish were cooked. They also cite the evidence of some small bowls sometimes found with the plates and believed to have held vinegar or other condiments meant to dress the fish. Additionally, and perhaps very tellingly, ""[t]hat fish-plates were used for the serving of fish seems likely from the fact that two plates from the Punic necropolis at Palermo, one red-figured (IB/7, below) and the other plain (B.C.A. 2/1-2, 1981, 134, fig. 17, 2; see below, p. 66), were found with a mass of fish-bones on them; they could also, of course, have been used for funerary purposes, and those of smaller dimensions were probably designed solely for that purpose."" 

While Trendall and McPhee indicate that establishing ""a chronology for South Italian fish-plates is a difficult task"" (58), they place the first, and very limited, South Italian manufacture of fish plates at Sicily and Calabria c. 380 BCE. When South Italian red-figured vase production increased in Campania, Paestum, and Apulia in the middle of the fourth century, the production of fish plates also increased. From c. 350-320 BCE, South Italian workshops made these in large numbers. Trendall and McPhee identify few fish plates which match what they refer to as the ""barbarised"" style of late South Italian red-figure, and so identify 320 BCE as a time after which the volume of manufacture of these vessels diminished greatly.

Since the two attribute this vessel to one of the workshops which succeeded that of Asteas and Python, it seems logical to place the date of our vessel at some point towards or after the middle of that 350-320 BCE period, perhaps around 335 BCE.

For a discussion of the types of marine life depicted on South Italian fish plates, see Trendall and McPhee 1987, 57-58.

LaCroix has collected the very sparse literary evidence apparently referring to fish plates, and limited to Aristophanes and scholiasts on Aristophanes. Although there is no description of the shape or decoration of these plates, the literature refers to 'ichthyeros pinakiskos', plausibly translated as fish plates or boards. See La Croix 1937, 34-35.

They were produced and used in Cyprus in the Late Bronze Age (Late Cypriot II to Late Cypriot III periods). While they are usually interpreted relation to divinity and, more specifically, in terms of either or both female fertility and sexuality, greater precision has been elusive: it is not clear that they depict a goddess, let alone a specific goddess. Many known examples either were found in early excavations that did not systematically record precise, stratified findspots or lack both provenience (archaeological findspot) and robust provenance (modern histories of ownership); this state of information means that for many examples, archaeological context can only be brought to bear on the interpretation in limited ways. Where they have been found in situ (in place), they have been found in settlements or burials more frequently than in sanctuaries; use in one context, however, does not preclude others.[1]

Some other examples have earrings, made of terracotta loops, in the holes in the ears; some carry infants.

Their resemblance to Middle Bronze Age terracotta figurines of nude females with beak-like faces, found across the northern Syrian zone (today’s northern Syria and eastern Turkey), has led to the suggestion that the form of these Cypriot figurines was influenced by the Syrian figurines.

[1] See Chapter 4 of Constantina Alexandrou. 2016. Following the Life-Cycle of Base-Ring Female Figurines in Late Bronze Age Cyprus. Ph.D. diss., Trinity College Dublin.",Handmade,"This hollow, handmade terracotta figurine takes the form of a nude, standing female figure. The figure has large semi-circular ears, each with two vertically-stacked, round, pierced holes. Chevron-shaped incisions on the forehead (the edge of a slightly flattened top of the head) may indicate hair or a brow. The eyes are made from applied circular pellets incised with circles to indicate pupils. The pinched nose is thin, tall, and projecting, lending a “bird-like” appearance to the face. There is no indication of a mouth.

Three horizontal incisions encircle the figurine’s cylindrical neck, perhaps indicating a necklace or collar. The body gradually widens from the neck to form hips, below which the legs narrow, tapering toward the feet. 

Applied spheres of clay form cone-shaped breasts. Scars on the sides indicate that arms, once attached and held akimbo, are now missing; the lower scar on either side corresponds to five incised lines on the front of the body, indicating fingers resting on the hips. The navel is indicated through an indented “dimple.” The pubic area is delineated and decorated in incision: outlined with two horizontal lines above and a diagonal line on each leg, smaller gouged incisions fill the triangle, giving the appearance of horizontal bands in an irregular chevron or herringbone pattern. A deep vertical groove demarcates the legs on front and back. On each leg, an indented “dimple” appears to indicate either knee. Small feet project at a downward angle; toes are incised. A small hole in the center of the figurine’s back (which bows out slightly but is not modeled) appears to have been drilled post-firing. Below this, the object’s accession number (1953.118) and “Fogg” are written in red paint; “1955” is written in black in or paint.

These figurines—with their curious faces (sometimes deemed “bird-like”), elaborate headdresses, and emphatic hips—are puzzling.

Their applied breasts and incised pubic triangles mark them as female, encouraging modern interpretations about fertility and sexuality. Number 5 [1953.118], likely made on the island of Cyprus, shows similar features, attesting to ideas about female bodies shared between distant but connected communities of the eastern Mediterranean and western Asia during the Bronze Age. 
Who exactly do they depict? Goddesses or worshippers? Both or neither? Any answers are complicated by wrinkles in their modern stories that raise a more urgent question: are these objects even ancient?

Although the details of the depiction of the tree on this and other vases do not make explicit what species is represented, in this case the mythological context makes it clear that we must understand it as a pine. In general, as Jennifer Neils has shown, Athenian depictions of the exploits of Theseus make extensive and unusual use of landscape elements, like rocks and especially trees, to define and differentiate his different deeds and the specific sites where they took place.

One particularly important association of pine trees in Greek antiquity was with the biannual Isthmian Games, one of the four great Panhellenic Games along with the Olympic Games. Winners at the Isthmian Games were awarded a crown made from pine needles. Theseus was often considered to be the founder, or at least a reorganiser, of the Isthmian Games, and at least one source (the Parian Marble, CIG 2374, 1. 36) reports that he founded them specifically in honor of his defeat of Sinis, who lived at the Isthmus near where the games were held.

Sinis was a bandit who lived at the Isthmus of Corinth, the only land-route from the Greek mainland to the Peloponnesian peninsula, and would trick travelers into helping him bend trees down to the ground and releasing them so they were catapulted by the tree as it sprang back up. Because of this, he was sometimes called Pityokamptes, “Pine-bender”. 

This scene shows the Athenian hero Theseus outwitting Sinis and using his own trick against him. The unbearded Theseus stands on the left, wearing a short tunic (chiton) and holding Sinis’ left wrist in his right hand, looking down at the crouching Sinis. In his left hand he holds a coniferous tree bent down towards the ground, with its leaves and branches painted in added red. Guidelines from a preliminary sketch can be seen at the base of the tree. Sinis is on the right, nude and with long hair and a beard, facing Theseus but crouching down with his left leg extended, and his left arm extended and held by Theseus.

They are often referred to as ""genre"" scenes. Here, the artists were concerned with more relaxed poses, elaborate drapery, and placing the female figure in interesting and unique positions that showcase the movement and twisting of the human body. Many of these figurines have been found in cemeteries and are thought to have been accompaniments for the dead, though some might have been kept in the home as personal possessions as well as dedicated at sanctuaries. 

Such figurines give attention to the world of mortals while often still referencing traditional imagery and subject matter. Here, for example, the depicted girl’s actions, though seated, are that of the longstanding, popular image of a woman (or goddess) adjusting her sandals (often called the “sandalbinder” by scholars, though she may be adjusting, removing, or tying them on). For example, a famous relief on the parapet of the Temple of Athena Nike at the Athenian Acropolis (dating to c. 410 BCE) shows the goddess Nike both bending over and lifting her leg to reach her sandal. Many subsequent variations of the pose in Hellenistic art show the goddess Aphrodite tying her sandals; these are often associated with bathing due to Aphrodite's nudity in the depictions. Thus, this every-day image of a girl may tap into the allure or power of Aphrodite, offering a clue as why it may have attracted an ancient owner. 

This figurine bears traces of Prussian blue pigment (first synthesized in the 18th century) along with pigments consistent with use in antiquity (red and yellow ochres): it may be evidence of a modern (18th or 19th century) touch-up rather than a sign that it is a modern. Nevertheless, some questions about the sculptural form (such as the open form of the stool and the lack of known parallels for this specific figurine type) leave open the possibility that this object is a modern forgery. The late nineteenth century saw an uptick in the production of forged Hellenistic-style terracotta figurines, as a result of a collecting craze set off in the 1870s by the discovery of Hellenistic terracotta figurines in the cemeteries of ancient Tangara (modern Schimatari, Greece) as well as at sites in Asia Minor (such as Smyrna and Myrina, in modern western Türkiye).",Mold-made,,Terracotta,Seated Girl Tying Sandal,Gift,"Ionides Collection, London, (by 1913).

Art historians describe this stance as an “S-curve”: the bend of a knee and the jutting of the opposite one hip to the side cause the torso and shoulders to shift in response, taking the spine into a S-shaped curve. This is a relaxed pose that implies pliability. These young men are depicted in ways that emphasize their youth (underdeveloped muscles, no mature facial and pubic hair) and speak to contemporary ideas about desirability. They wear a variety of hairstyles, including ornate curls topped by headdresses (wreaths?), and they often hold objects (most frequently a rooster). 

They were made in Greek communities (especially in Boiotia, Athens, and Corinth) from the fifth century through the third century BCE. These small statues were versatile objects: ancient Greeks buried them in graves with the deceased, dedicated them to gods at sanctuaries, and likely kept them in their households as well.

Often associated with the goddess Hera/Juno in mythology, peacocks were considered sacred and held a variety of meanings in Roman art including eternal life (2). 

The panel comes from an unidentified structure, possibly a domestic space, in the Feleet Village area near Daphne, a suburb of Antioch in modern-day Turkey. It was found, along with a second mosaic of the same subject, during the 1936 excavations led by the Committee for the Excavation of Antioch and its Vicinity. 

Notes:
1.  For similarly stylized peacocks see those in the upper level of the House of Bird Rinceau, upper level (Doro Levi, Antioch Mosaic Pavements (Princeton University Press, 1947), pl.

2. For an ancient source consult Ovid, Metamorphoses I, 622-723. The peacock was also considered a counterpart for the eagle of Zeus/Jupiter, as seen in this example, Anna Gonosova, ""Mosaic with Peacocks,"" in The Arts of Antioch, (Princeton University Press, 2005), 238-242. Christine Kondoleon, Domestic and Divine: Roman Mosaics in the House of Dionysos (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1994), 109.",,"This polychrome mosaic floor pavement depicts twelve birds on a plain, white background framed by a decorative, guilloche border in shades of green, yellow, and red. In the center of the panel stands a large bird, probably an eagle that faces forward bearing its breast and spreading its wings. 

In the lower register of the panel, two peacocks face one another. A peacock tail is preserved in the lower left composed of purple, pink, and green tesserae. The head of a second bird appears in the lower right. The peacock’s tail is rendered as a vertical plane and the feathers are carefully positioned in a repeating, stylized pattern. The remaining nine birds are spread throughout the panel and include such species as a goose, pheasant, and partridge (1). Tesserae in shades of yellow, brown, green, gray and purple create limited modeling the birds' forms.


1. Levi identifies the birds as a heron, duck, partridge, and parrot. For parrots, see House of the Beribboned Parrots; for an eagle in the same pose at Antioch see the House of Dionysus and Ariadne (Levi II, pl. CLXXIX.a)

A slave or comic actor, standing, dressed, and burdened with a yoke. Bald, rounded head cocked slightly to the right. Deeply wrinkled forehead; narrow, wavy eyebrows; large, almond-shaped eyes with narrow lids rendered in relief. Somewhat large nose, now worn; closed mouth; rounded chin. Prominent, stylized ears. Overall expression seems happy or smiling. 

He wears a short tunic with short sleeves under a paenula (a cloak that is similar to a poncho). The paenula’s large V-neck takes up most of the figure’s torso; stiff, plastic folds at front, somewhat looser at back. Right arm and hand are visible, if modeled a bit crudely, placed across the chest and holding a staff. The left hand seems to be grasping the yoke from behind and is mostly obscured by the paenula. The thinness of the visible arm suggests emaciation. The bare legs, set apart with knees slightly bent, are overly thick by comparison. The pose allows for a rounded protrusion to peek out from under the short tunic; a missing attachment could be a prosthetic phallus. Bare feet, with incised toes. 

The man carries a yoke behind his neck, one woven basket hanging from a thick rope at each side. The baskets are cylindrical, with vertical weaving along the body and two horizontal bands at both top and bottom. The man stands on a rectangular base with simple molding at sides and front, and a plain back.

Would have been painted originally. Traces of thick white ground extant, especially at front.

The figure is hollow, and made in a single bivalve mold, plaster. Significant modeling at back. Join seams are sharp and visible, but tidy. No venthole. The base was made separately; solid, with a slightly concave bottom. Partial fingerprint at the bottom edge of the base. The figurine stands on its own for the most part, but it is slightly unstable. The linear treatment of features and incised detailing, like that of the weave of the baskets and ropes, suggest a later Imperial date.

Roman lamps are typically made of either terracotta or bronze and are mold-made. Typically the body is round and closed on top and there is a nozzle with a pick. Terracotta lamps are usually decorated with a wide variety of motifs. In houses, lamps may have stood on the top of a candelabrum (See: 1960.482) to light a room.

This African Red Slipware lamp is identified as the Hayes Type I, characterized by its broad nozzle-channel, unpierced handle, simple decoration, and grooved shoulders (1). It is likely that this shape originated in Tunisia and dated finds are no earlier than the end of the fourth century CE.  A second, similar shape (Hayes Type II) is found into the seventh century CE and display a smooth handle, base-ring, and level shoulders, among other distinctions (2). 

The single circle mark on the bottom of the lamp is found on other Tunisian lamps. The frequent occurence on these lampe suggests that mark is decorative rather than a makers mark (3). In addition to the lamps made in Tunisia, there exist lamps made in Italy, but modelled on imported, African Red Slip Ware with a Chi Rho decoration (4).

Romans played games that are very similar to games we play now. Though schooling was strict for young boys, often children would play games at home with ivory pieces, knucklebones, marbles, dice, and dolls.  This doll was probably a children's toy. It is similar to those made in Corinth in the 4th century BCE. Toys such as these were often buried with a child if he or she died during childhood.

Almost all mummy portraits from the Roman period came from Northern Egypt, in an area called the Fayum. Mummy portraits are a unique representation of the human form. This medium developed in Egypt and had its roots in Egyptian burial practices. Egypt was taken over by the Romans in 30 BCE, after Octavian (later Augustus) defeated Marc Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BCE. Roman Egypt became a mixture of imported customs and deep-seated, Egyptian tradition. Mummy portraits were most popular in the 1st to 3rd centuries CE.

Mummy portraits were probably painted while the deceased was still alive. There is some debate as to whether they are idealized or painted in the exact likeness of the person. They are usually painted on wooden panels or on linen, most often utilizing the encaustic technique. Encaustic painting uses heated wax with pigment added to create colors.   

The portrait was attached to the coffin or mummy in the place where the face would be. They give us a glimpse into upper-class life in Roman Egypt, since only a wealthy person could afford to commission their painting. In addition, most females (and some males) are depicted wearing elaborate jewelry, often made of gold and featuring many precious stones. Some female mummy portraits show the deceased wearing up to seven necklaces.

An inscription from the villa suggests the owner was Agrippa Postumus (b.12 BCE-d. 14 CE), the son of Augustus' daughter Julia and her husband Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, the close advisor of the Emperor Augustus. Significant renovations occurred at the site following 12 BCE, suggesting a date for the paintings during the final decade of the first century BCE. The elegant and refined quality of this and other paintings at the villa provide some of the best examples of paintings, particularly outside of Rome, and certainly of the so-called Third Style. The Egyptianizing themes were favored by Augustus and other Roman elite during the years of the early Empire, following the victory over Cleopatra.

The villa was partly excavated from 1903-1905 and subsequently published in 1922, by the Italian archaeologist Matteo della Corte (1). Other panels were divided between collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museo Archeologico Nazionale di Napoli. A reconstructed panel combining the upper frieze from the west all with the primary, red register from the east wall of room 19 in the Metropolitan Museum of Art offers a model for this fragment's original wall context (2, 3).

This style of painting is commonly referred to as the First Style, Masonry Style, or International Incrustation Style (2). It is found in earlier Greek painting (for example in the houses at Delos), but is most known from its appearance in the houses of the Vesuvian region.

Unlike other Athenian pottery, which was regularly produced for export across the Mediterranean, and especially to Italy, white-ground lekythoi are only rarely found outside of Attica, the region surrounding Athens.

The white-ground decorative technique produces decoration which is much less stable than the red-figure or black-figure technique and is mostly used for vessels with funerary or ritual functions that do not demand heavy use. White ground lekythoi regularly feature decoration only on the front of the vessel, with the back left blank, and even decorative friezes extending only halfway around the vessel.

This type of vase was in common production from around 480 B.C.E. until towards the end of the fifth century. Its popularity in this period may be related to the absence of any private gravestones in Attica from around 490-80 to 430 B.C.E. Exactly why the Athenians stopped producing gravestones for half a century is not entirely clear, but the white-ground lekythos might be thought of as replicating some of the ritual and commemorative functions of a gravestone. A great many examples feature a representation of a grave monument.

These vases were designed to hold oil and seem to have been used in a number of different ways in funerary ritual: burned with the body in cremations, for pouring oil libations on the body or the grave site, and as offerings left at or in a burial. The great majority have been found in and around graves. 

Accordingly, their painted decoration usually features scenes connected with funerary ritual or the mythology of the afterlife, and can give us some insight into ancient Athenian funerary practices and ideas about death.

Unlike other Athenian pottery, which was regularly produced for export across the Mediterranean, and especially to Italy, white-ground lekythoi are only rarely found outside of Attica, the region surrounding Athens.

The white-ground decorative technique produces decoration which is much less stable than the red-figure or black-figure technique and is mostly used for vessels with funerary or ritual functions that do not demand heavy use. White ground lekythoi regularly feature decoration only on the front of the vessel, with the back left blank, and even decorative friezes extending only halfway around the vessel.

This type of vase was in common production from around 480 B.C.E. until towards the end of the fifth century. Its popularity in this period may be related to the absence of any private gravestones in Attica from around 490-80 to 430 B.C.E. Exactly why the Athenians stopped producing gravestones for half a century is not entirely clear, but the white-ground lekythos might be thought of as replicating some of the ritual and commemorative functions of a gravestone. A great many examples feature a representation of a grave monument.

These vases were designed to hold oil and seem to have been used in a number of different ways in funerary ritual: burned with the body in cremations, for pouring oil libations on the body or the grave site, and as offerings left at or in a burial. The great majority have been found in and around graves. 

Accordingly, their painted decoration usually features scenes connected with funerary ritual or the mythology of the afterlife, and can give us some insight into ancient Athenian funerary practices and ideas about death. This scene probably shows a visit to the grave by the family of the deceased. Sometimes scenes of this kind will include a figure who seems to represent the dead individual, but it is often not possible to make identifications like this with any certainty.

Unlike other Athenian pottery, which was regularly produced for export across the Mediterranean, and especially to Italy, white-ground lekythoi are only rarely found outside of Attica, the region surrounding Athens.

The white-ground decorative technique produces decoration which is much less stable than the red-figure or black-figure technique and is mostly used for vessels with funerary or ritual functions that do not demand heavy use. White ground lekythoi regularly feature decoration only on the front of the vessel, with the back left blank, and even decorative friezes extending only halfway around the vessel.

This type of vase was in common production from around 480 B.C.E. until towards the end of the fifth century. Its popularity in this period may be related to the absence of any private gravestones in Attica from around 490-80 to 430 B.C.E. Exactly why the Athenians stopped producing gravestones for half a century is not entirely clear, but the white-ground lekythos might be thought of as replicating some of the ritual and commemorative functions of a gravestone. A great many examples feature a representation of a grave monument.

These vases were designed to hold oil and seem to have been used in a number of different ways in funerary ritual: burned with the body in cremations, for pouring oil libations on the body or the grave site, and as offerings left at or in a burial. The great majority have been found in and around graves. 

Accordingly, their painted decoration usually features scenes connected with funerary ritual or the mythology of the afterlife, and can give us some insight into ancient Athenian funerary practices and ideas about death. This scene shows a visit to the grave by the family of the deceased. Sometimes scenes of this kind will include a figure who seems to represent the dead individual, but it is often not possible to make identifications like this with any certainty.

Ushabtis are ancient Egyptian funerary figurines that were buried with a deceased person (the owner) and designed to perform tasks for them in the afterlife. They were usually inscribed with the owner’s name. They were believed to be “activated” when the deceased owner recited a portion of the Book of the Dead that explained the ushabti’s duties, which is sometimes inscribed on them (see 2019.354 for an example of this text). In such inscriptions, the deceased person is referred to as the “illuminated Osiris”—a gesture toward the hope that they would be resurrected like the god Osiris and everlasting like the sun. Ushabtis were almost always made in sets so that there would be many figurines to serve the deceased person.

The Romans were the first to develop and use concrete. They started using it in construction during the Republic, during the second century BCE. Concrete is a mixture of cement, which acts as the binder, and an aggregate, which could be any material ranging from rocks to tiles. The cement was often hydraulic, meaning it was mixed with water and hardened over time. The Romans even knew how to use concrete under water, and examples of this type of architecture can be seen in the city of Caesarea. One of the most famous uses of Roman concrete is the Pantheon in Rome, which was built in 126 CE.

In this remarkable sketchbook of approximately ninety-six drawings, Mel Pekarsky explores the beauty and mysteries of the desert’s empty vastness. The allover compositions of his large-scale independent drawings—based on aerial photographs of desert landscapes—and the far more intimate depictions found in this sketchbook sustain a remarkable balance between abstraction and representation. Calling his drawings ""environmentally political,"" Pekarsky has become obsessed not only with recording the desert’s vastness but also conveying its fragility and vulnerability:

The desert is vast, but fragile and vulnerable. It’s beautiful, rapidly and 
constantly changing: neat. I try to bring this back, not as a souvenir or 
picture, but as icon and metaphor. I’m interested in surface, in the precision 
of chance, in the controlled gesture, and the quiet intensity of nature’s 
violence here.

Artificial lighting in the Roman Empire was accomplished with torches, candles and lamps. Torches were used outdoors, while candles made of wax were used mainly in areas that did not have olive oil. Lamps were the most common means of light, used all over the Empire, but especially where oil was produced or imported. 

Lamps range from decorative to functional, though all utilize the same basic features. The oil chamber inside holds the fuel, while the hole at the top is for filling. There is usually a nozzle and a wick-hole for wicks that were made of fibrous materials, most often linen. Lamps themselves could be made in bronze, lead, iron, gold, silver, glass, or stone. However, the most common construction material for lamps was pottery. Though they could be made by hand or on a potter's wheel, they were most often constructed in molds. 

First, the maker would construct a clay archetype of the lamp that would be solid, not hollow. Then a plaster mold would be made of the archetype. The mold would often be two parts, an upper and lower part, that wet clay could be pressed into to make a new lamp. When the clay was leather-hard, additional decorations, stamps, or handles could be added, and the wick and filling holes were pierced. A coat of slip was put on before the lamp would be fired in a kiln. 

Lamps were distributed both by local workshops and by export from specialty workshops. There is some archaeological evidence for specific names of workshops and their trade routes, but still much is unknown about these factories. Sometimes makers left marks on the bottom of their lamps, which can help archaeologists in determining where the lamp was originally from.

[Jessica Pesce 8/5/10]


For similar maker's marks, see Bailey, D. M.  A Catalogue of the Lamps in the British Museum, vol. I, Q714 and Q715 and pp. 326 and 339-340, and pl. 2. Bailey attributes this series of marks to one of probably a few central Italian workshops active in the first century BCE (p. 326).

It is difficult to find an exact shape parallel for this lamp among the terracotta examples. It is much more similar in shape to several of the metal lamps of this period. See, for example, Bailey vol. IV, nos. Q3544 and Q3553.

Roman lamps are typically made of either terracotta or bronze and are mold-made. Typically the body is round and closed on top and there is a nozzle with a pick. Terracotta lamps are usually decorated with a wide variety of motifs. In houses, lamps may have stood on the top of a candelabrum (See: 1960.482) to light a room.

The maker's mark on the base of this lamp, L. M. ADIEC, is that of the workshop of L. Munatus Adiectus. Although found twice as often in north Africa than on the Italian peninsula, based on the fabric and stamp forms, this particular lamp may come from a central Italian workshop, most active during the Flavian and Trajanic periods, and with an extensive African export trade (1). 

Notes: 
1. Most similar to Type P lamps in  D. Bailey, A Catalogue of the Lamps in the British Museum, vol. II (British Museum Publications, 1988), p. 92, fig. 107. For a similar nozzle channel, see specifically Q1317 and Q1318, produced in the late Flavian to Hadrianic periods.

",Mold-made,"Mold made lamp with a flat base delineated by a circular groove. A maker's mark on base reads: L M ADIEC. Below this inscription is a small, incuse crescent, pointing upwards. Curved, flaring walls form a mid-volume reservoir while the rim slopes upward, separated from the concave discus by three circular ridges. On the discus a male figure (Apollo?), draped at the waist and with a billowing cape arched above his head. The figure reclines on a swimming dolphin, below which is located the circular filling hole. The nozzle is short and rounded with a horizontal upper edge. A small channel runs between the filling hole on the discus and the horizontal edge of the nozzle. Pierced, vertical handle with a double groove.  

Orange-tan, micaceous, heavy fabric. Dark orange slip mostly worn away. Striations on surface of lamp appear to be from an attempt at smoothing when the clay was too dry.

Despite Brunn’s failed efforts to become a history painter, he remained in Paris and worked as a scene painter for the French royal theater. This may explain the old-fashioned seventeenth-century ruffs seen in so many of his portraits. 

The fact that this was once considered to be a drawing by one of the Willes is not surprising. The elder Wille was one of the two most important engravers in later eighteenth-century Paris and an avid collector. His home and studio became a meeting place for northern Europeans in the French capital. His students included the young Austrian painter Jakob Mathias Schmutzer (to whom the present sheet was also once attributed), who eventually became the founding director of the Imperial Art Academy in Vienna. The red chalk drawing style of both Brunn and Schmutzer also owes a great debt to the justifiably celebrated virtuoso technique of the French painter and draftsman Jean-Baptiste Greuze, who was, not surprisingly, a very close friend of the elder Wille and the teacher of the younger Wille. Indeed, thanks to the writings and correspondence of friends like the elder Wille and Friedrich Melchior, Baron von Grimm, Greuze enjoyed greater celebrity in northern Europe than he did in France, and both he and Wille either trained or influenced a number of northern artists and collectors during their stay in Paris.",,,Two distinct shades of red chalk on off-white antique laid paper,Head of a Young Man,Purchase,"Annamaria Edelstein at Succi Ltd., London (as of 1987), sold; to Jeffrey E.

He would then rework the plate, adding depth to shadows and burnishing down lines that he wished to appear lighter, so that the composition, which in the single-bite stage lay as a flat screen on the paper, would through its tonal enrichment flex into a three-dimensional space.  In the case of this composition, perhaps despairing of his capacity to establish deep space where the vista was broken in the mid-ground by a prominent structure (the so-called House with a Portico), Canaletto cut the plate in half and reworked each side separately.

We are standing at a lock, watching a burchiello ride the current downstream. The artist's contemporary, the Venetian dramatist Carlo Goldoni, has also left us a picture of the water-bus of their time: ""a fine boat with looking-glasses, carving and pictures, that goes a mile in twenty minutes and where you can relax, sit down or doze in absolute security."" 

The etching is one of thirty-one plates by Canaletto that were published in 1745 as a set titled Vedute, altre prese da i luoghi, altre idealte (Views, Some Showing Actual Sites, Some Imaginary). All commentators have remarked upon the series's neglect of the artist's most popular painted subject, the city of Venice itself. Its representation was in great demand, especially by Milords on the Grand Tour who were directed to the artist by his close friend Joseph Smith, the British consul at Venice. Smith published the etchings, and after his death, when the plates were republished by Remondini in 1772, their emphasis on mainland sites was made explicit by the description in the editore's catalogue: “A series representing some views of places on the Brenta, others imaginary.” 

In 1778 Remondini sold four views separately as ""A stitched series of 4 prints black representing the Views of Dolo.”  Curiously, while this subset contains the three views onto which the artist himself etched titles referring to Dolo, the fourth was The Portico with a Lantern, left untitled by the artist and never associated with Dolo by later commentators.  Two other plates, however, have been identified as showing the town, albeit with the clock omitted from the campanile of San Rocco in the one and with the scene set in a mountainous landscape in the other. Ale Porte del Dolo came to Harvard within a set of four, but this set contains only one other of the views of Dolo, and all four are anything but later republications. All are first states of some of Canaletto's largest and most complex etched compositions, and three are of the utmost rarity, being working proofs, including an impression of the undivided plate of the Imaginary View of Venice. All four are inscribed: ""N[orton] Coll[ection] Oct. 1874."" 

At that moment Charles Eliot Norton was just beginning his career teaching art history at Harvard. One course was on Venetian art, but he concluded his survey centuries earlier than the work of Canaletto. While Canaletto was despised as a painter by Norton’s mentor Ruskin and probably by Norton as well, he was valued for his representation of Venice prior to the city’s despoiling (as Ruskin and Norton saw it) by nineteenth-century modernizations and--worse--restorations.  Thus it is not unexpected to find at Harvard prints by Canaletto, the only form of the artist’s views that would have been accessible to the limited budget of the fledgling teaching program. But most prints from the Fine Arts Department collection are minor compositions in mediocre impressions; why Canaletto is represented by his best etchings in superb proof states in perfect condition remains a mystery.",Etching,,Etching printed in black ink on white antique laid paper,Alle Porte del Dolo,Not Recorded,,c. 1741,Department of Prints,1746,"[{'role': 'Artist', 'birthplace': 'Venice, Italy', 'gender': 'male', 'displaydate': '1697 - 1768', 'prefix': None, 'culture': 'Italian', 'displayname': 'Giovanni Antonio Canal, called Canaletto', 'alphasort': 'Canaletto, Giovanni Antonio Canal, called', 'name': 'Giovanni Antonio Canal, called Canaletto', 'personid': 30903, 'deathplace': 'Venice, Italy', 'displayorder': 1}]",https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/299984,18th century,FA11,,Italian,299984,plate: 29.5 × 43.4 cm (11 5/8 × 17 1/16 in.)

Probably because of the conservative customs associated with this religious festival, Panathenaic amphorae remained relatively standard in shape and decoration, holding an average of about thirty-nine liters or one ‘metretes,’ an Athenian unit of liquid measure, and were always decorated in the black-figure technique, long after that decoration had been abandoned for the red-figure style. Awarded as prizes in the games as late as the second century BCE, Panathenaic amphorae are testimony to the unique and enduring tradition of this Athenian festival and its prizes.",Black-figure,"Side A: Athena Promachos advancing to right clothed in an archaic Ionic chiton ornamented with a dotted border in white and provided with rudimentary sleeves ending in two swallow-tails thrown over each shoulder, Attic helmet with tall crest, and brandishing a spear in her right while covering herself with a shield which she holds in her left. Her head, helmet, and right hand project into the upper border. On both shoulders and breast, crossing cords in white with a central knot which originally supported th e aegis, but now has almost entirely disappeared. Traces of a bracelet on her right wrist and sandals on her feet in light brown. On either side of her a Doric column, supporting a figure, that on the left a female, helmeted figure (probably Athena), holding a tiller, that on the right Zeus with sceptre and Nike. Along each column the inscriptions ""kionedon,"" on the left TON ATHENETHEN ATHLON, on the right THEIOPHRASTOS ERXE.

Side B: Athletic scene. In the center, two nude boxers full front, their hands bound with the cestus. At the right a trainer to left wearing a cloak draped over his left arm and a wreath in his hair, holding a staff in his left, his right outstretched. At the left a female figure draped entirely in a mantle which leaves only the upper part of her face bare, the lower part being outlined beneath it, leaning on a Doric column. Beside her head OLYMPIAS.

Spout, shoulder, handles, and base glazed, with a reserved band on upper part of base. Palmette chain on neck at junction of handles and below an elongated tongue pattern shorter on B than on A. Panel on each side containing the design, that of A longer than B. Applied white is used for the exposed flesh surfaces of Athena and the details of her drapery, as well as those of the figures on the columns on A, head and feet of Olympias, wreath and staff of trainer and the column on B. Execution careful with good incisions, originally filled with white.

Made in Athens or surrounding Attica, it depicts Athena, goddess of war and the city’s patron deity, charging ahead in battle. An inscription identifies it as one of the containers filled with local olive oil and awarded as prizes at the athletic games of the Panathenaia, a festival honoring Athena. Dated more precisely than most ancient objects, it was made “when Theiophrastos was magistrate,” or 340–339 BCE. Old-fashioned features in its design signaled the antiquity of the Panathenaic games. The swallow-tail hemlines of Athena’s dress, for example, mimic artistic styles of a previous period.

Two brawny boxers, their hands bound with leather thongs, illustrate the contest in which this amphora was awarded. Victorious boxers received 60 amphoras of Athenian olive oil at the Panathenaic games. Roughly equal to 600 gallons, this was a valuable prize. The boxers are framed by a partly veiled personification of the Olympic games (“Olympias”) and a bearded referee. The black-figure technique, long outmoded when this vessel was painted, contrasts sharply with the more advanced rendering of the human figures. Note the elongated bodies with relatively small heads, full and three-quarter views with foreshortened limbs, and relaxed and leaning poses.",Greek,303742,80 cm h x 39 cm diam (31 1/2 x 15 3/8 in.)

Impy appears here twice with his family: his daughters Kerfet, Ity, and Khuit stand behind him on the left fragment, and his wife Hatkau and son Impy (Jr.) stand behind him on the right. Something, however, is missing in between these family portraits. 
This relief was deliberately cut into at least three pieces, perhaps for sale, at some point after antiquity. The missing central portion once contained a three-line hieroglyphic inscription that allowed Impy to have what he needs for a successful afterlife—now disrupted by this loss. Careful study through digital drawing and comparison with other tomb inscriptions reveals that, at minimum, the bottom line contained Impy’s title and nickname. Therefore, the missing portion must have been at least as wide as indicated in the line drawing (right).",Egyptian,303779,max. H. 32.4 × W. 94 × D. 7 cm (12 3/4 × 37 × 2 3/4 in.)

He turns the paper around as he works, so that no particular orientation was essential, although he thinks this one probably does work best in the orientation in which we have it.  He is introspective in these drawings-- using a surrealist automatism in a very introspective way.  He adds the ribbon collage elements to add spatial depth and variety to the drawing, which otherwise gets more and more ""flat"" toward the central area.  The ribbons don't have any special significance to him other than adding this spatial complexity.  He says he's been using them since his early teens.

This unique portrait depicts the “Maharani” (Hindi for empress) Queen Victoria (r. 1837–1901), bare-breasted and cuddling Princess Victoria Adelaide Mary Louise under her mantle. It evokes both the Madonna and Child of Western culture and Yashodhra, the adoptive mother of the god Krishna, nursing her child—an image that can be traced back to first-century Hindu paintings. 
  The flatness of the queen’s forehead and her awkward three-quarter profile suggest that the Indian painter was grappling with Western concepts of volume and perspective. In Indian eyes Victoria’s daughter would be proof of continued lineage. We can only imagine how her dishabille, which symbolized fertility to Indians, might have affected the Victorian sense of propriety.

During the Crown Raj period, toward the end of the nineteenth century, Rajasthani nobles often commissioned paintings modeled after European portraiture to attest to their status. With the advent of photography in India, local artists increasingly employed photographs as painting aids, appropriating studio photography’s compositional and stylistic elements, as is evident in this portrait. Seated in a Victorian chair among Roman columns, lush drapery with heavy tassels, and a plush, meticulously rendered emerald carpet, this Begum (an honorific title given to an aristocratic woman) is surrounded by modern luxuries that reflect European tastes. As befits a young Begum, the subject’s pose is formal and demure. Her elaborate jewelry conveys her wealth and stature: in particular, the portrait pendant of the Maharaja reflects the common practice among Rajputs to wear necklaces bearing the likeness of their family’s patron deity to indicate clan identity.

Although most of the wall painting was of only a solid color, a few elaborately decorated fragments survived and were still vibrant enough to be photographed and drawn in situ. The excavators cut out and packaged a substantial portion of the mudbrick wall upon which the elaborate wall painting was executed. The hope was to carefully extract and preserve the design under more controlled laboratory conditions, but the fragments did not survive shipping intact.

Luckily, the designs had been copied by the excavation's architect Emmanuel Wilensky while still in situ, and these drawings represented the ruined wall paintings in exhibits for both the Fogg and Semitic Museums. Wilensky's original field copies have since been lost; although the Semitic Museum has photographs of these drawings taken soon after completion. Before the loss of Wilensky's drawings, however, Edward Forbes, director of the Fogg Museum, had new color copies made for the Fogg Museum.

Helen Gilman and Lucille Chabot, members of the Fogg Museum staff, created the watercolor copies of Wilensky's drawings between 1941 and 1943, using the original mudbrick fragments for color reference.

The sideways stringed ""head"" at the upper right is related to a diminutive (512  inches high) lead-and-string sculpture from 1939. In the late 1930s Moore began to experiment with wax crayons and watercolor to create a resist. After drawing on the paper with transparent crayon, he would apply watercolor to the whole; the drawn areas would not ""take"" the washes and would emerge from the background. The drawing would then be embellished with ink and colored crayon to describe and animate the forms. --Miriam Stewart",,,"Watercolor, gouache, black ink, colored crayons, orange resinous ink, transparent crayon (wax resist), incised lines on off-white wove paper; verso: black chalk",Ideas for Sculpture; verso: Reclining figure on a pedestal,Gift,"[Buchholz Gallery, Curt Valentin, New York, New York], sold; to Lois Orswell, Pomfret Center, Connecticut, 1944, gift; to Harvard University Art Museums, 1993.",1940,Department of Drawings,1940,"[{'role': 'Artist', 'birthplace': 'Castleford, W.

The demands included the abolition of ROTC at Harvard, more scholarships, lower rent for those living in university-owned apartments, and the promise that occupied housing would not be demolished for the construction of new Harvard buildings. Disgruntled with the administration's lack of response, the student protestors stormed University Hall that day at noon and ordered all deans and administrative staff to vacate the building. State troopers and local police forcibly removed the demonstrators just before dawn the following morning. 145 Harvard and Radcliffe students were arrested. In the wake of the police action, Harvard students decided to strike until their demands were met. Two more demands were added to the original six: that student protestors not be punished and that Black Studies be added to the curriculum.

Printing became the protestors' most powerful tool. They published documents purloined from the deans' offices in the underground newspaper, Old Mole. Graduate School of Design students established the Strike Poster Workshop in the Great Space of Robinson Hall. They chose the red fist as the symbol of their dissent, designed silkscreens and cut stencils, and printed the fist on paper, t-shirts, and arm bands. The April 13 issue of the Old Mole stated, ""The GSD people in Robinson Hall will silkscreen a red fist on anything you bring in: t-shirt, jacket, poster, your ass. They are working practically all the time."" The workshop created a variety of strike poster designs with an assortment of protest slogans, including ""End ROTC,"" ""Maybe They Can't Hear Us, Strike a Little Louder,"" and ""12345678 STRIKE."" Students carried them during rallies, posted them on trees, buildings, and other facades across the Yard and Square. Photographs of the turmoil appeared in the national press, including the New York Times and Life magazine. The publicity photographs often featured the printed materials of the Strike Poster Workshop. In the aftermath of the strike, some of the protesters' demands were met-ROTC was eliminated, the charges against the students who occupied University Hall were dropped, and Black Studies was made a field of concentration.

As with so many other Fluxus editions, ""Flux Atlas"" was produced in serveral variants over the years. Unlike the version already in the collection, this object is a ""ReFlux"" edition. Maciunas tended to have a store of materials (boxes, labels, and--in this case--rocks) and would produce the theoretically unlimited Fluxus editions in batches as demand dictated.  ReFlux was founded by Barbara Moore after Maciunas's death as a way to continue, in accordance with his wishes, to publish Fluxus editions using his existing stock of materials. Because there were many more labels and box ""contents"" than there were boxes, ReFlux editions often use new boxes obtained from Maciunas's original supplier in the same configurations as the vintage editions. In order to differentiate them from the ""vintage"" editions (a slightly perverse compromise, given Maciunas's attitudes), each piece of vintage material employed is stamped or blind-stamped ""ReFlux."" In traditional terms, such objects have the conceptual status of ""authorized"" posthumous impressions of the sort issued by artists' estates.

Like it's vintage counterpart, this edition is one example of how the members of the geographically-dispersed Fluxus community could work to each other's mutual benefit. In the April, 1973 Fluxnewsletter, Maciunas sent out a call for assistance: ""We need about 50 pebbles...from specific and well described locations (country, town vicinity, which beach or shore, which sea, lake or river). This is for a large Geography box by Bob Watts, which will contain pebbles from various parts of the world....All contributors will receive a box in return."" In its emphasis on collective artistic production and worldwide geographic distribution, it is closely aligned with works like Mieko (Chieko) Shiomi's series of ""Spatial Poems"" (M26472-M26475). Where Shiomi's works existed as coordinated but ultimately ephemeral actions, gaining their physical form through the gathering of information, Watts' edition gathers physical matter itself. As is often the case, much of the work necessary to transform the object from a ""box of rocks"" into a ""Flux Atlas"" is performed by Maciunas' label design. The compartmentalization of the designation ""a flux atlas by bob watts"" on the label mirrors the structure of the box's interior. The label's graphic association with a premodern cartographic tradition both indicates that this atlas is founded on actual experience rather than on rational, scientific principles, and participates in the longstanding Fluxus appropriation of outmoded graphic idioms.",,A 24-compartment transparent plastic box with printed label on lid.

She determined to make a copy of the original photogravure and manipulate it with her race, history, and identity driven iconography.

Ceramics decorated with cobalt blue on a white ground were first produced—albeit briefly—by potters working during the Tang dynasty (618–907) in China and for the `Abbasid dynasty centered in Iraq. The blue-and-white combination inspired one of the longest-running and most influential ceramic dia¬logues between eastern and western Asia. There is at present a lively disagreement among scholars as to which culture should be credited with its invention.

Originally a disciple of Anthony Caro, Tucker made his reputation as an abstract welder (his work was included in Rosalind Krauss's seminal Passages in Modern Sculpture) before turning in recent decades to a more traditional practice of modeling in which parts of bodies (hands, torsos, horse's heads) are vigorously rendered and then cast at large scale.  Charcoal drawings for these sculptures form a major part of his work as well.  

The present piece dates from a moment of transition in Tucker's career.  It was made in 1982 during an Italian sojourn under the influence of Donatello and is part of a large edition. The artist reports (email to Harry Cooper, 6 June 2007):  ""I made it in the negative, in a clay mould and poured plaster into it to create the relief.  The patina simulates the appearance of the original plaster, with traces of red clay …. I made several studies for a large sculpture with this image, in prints, drawings and a free standing maquette.""

In addition to his work as a sculptor, Tucker had a long teaching career and is a noted writer on sculpture, best known for his 1974 book The Language of Sculpture.  (He participated in the 2003 HUAM symposium on Medardo Rosso.)  Recent museum exhibitions have included an installation of his earlier work at MoMA and a show of his Horses at the DeCordova Museum.

He was born in Leeds, Yorkshire and studied at Leeds College of Art and at the Slade School of Fine Art, London. Armitage's early works were carved in stone, but in the post-war years he began casting in bronze, initially using plaster and later clay modeled on metal armatures. By the 1960s he had begun working with wax, resin and aluminum. He first attracted international attention at the 26th Venice Biennale in 1952 as one of a group of young British sculptors including Reg Butler, Lynn Chadwick, and Eduardo Paolozzi, who are all represented in the Fogg collection.

Armitage's solid, bulky forms articulate strong horizontal and vertical lines through their protruding attenuated limbs. Of Armitage's rendering of the human form, Roland Penrose writes, ""The idioms used by him, such as the melting together of two or more bodies, the unison of their movement, the stretching, probing gestures of slender limbs, even the small mushroom-shaped heads that contribute to the monumental scale of the massive body beneath them, all these features characteristic of his work convey a playful affectionate attitude.""  The horizontal thrust of Figure on Back is complemented by the verticality of Family Group (n.d.), also in the Harvard Art Museum's collection, and there is a direct relationship with the charcoal drawing, Reclining Figure (1957) in the Drawings Department.

Nurhan Atasoy and Julian Raby (Iznik 1989) call this ""The Saz Leaf and Rosette Style"" after the essential motifs in the designs. Atasoy and Raby link this phase to the influence of the artist Sahkulu, who headed the atelier of the Ottoman court designers (cemaat-i nakkasan) from 1526 until his death in 1556. Earlier scholars, following the lead of Arthur Lane (Ars Orientalis, 1957), refer to this as the ""Damascus Phase"" of Iznik pottery. Lane's Damascus Phase is broader than Atasoy and Raby's Saz Leaf and Rosette Style, extending from c. 1525-55, for he focused less on specific motifs than on the distinctive palette of cobalt, turquoise, sage-green, and purple. The most sensitive drawing and the full palette appear on vessels. By contrast, tiles, which are quite rare for this phase/style, are only painted in cobalt and turquoise, and their drawing betrays somewhat the effect of mass production. 

Sources for the saz style in Ottoman art can be found in fifteenth-century Persian drawings. Sahkulu (Shah Quli) himself was a Tabrizi.
 
Identical tiles are found in the collections of the British Museum (OA92 6-13 69) and the Victoria and Albert Museum (1680.1892), gifted to these institutions in 1892 by Sir Augustus Wollaston Franks (1826-97), celebrated English antiquary, collector, and a major figure in the history of the British Museum.

Arthur M. Sackler Museum, Promised gift of Elizabeth S. Ettinghausen in memory of Richard Ettinghausen, 9.2006

The twisting serrated leaves and fantastic blossoms suspended from a rotating stem characterize the so-called saz leaf and rosette style. Introduced into Ottoman art in the late 1520s by Sahkulu, an artist originally from Tabriz in Iran, the saz style’s earliest appearance takes the form of ink drawings on paper. The spiraling, self-contained design of this tile contrasts with the symmetrical and endlessly repeating patterns of the adjacent hexagonal tiles.
",,The hexagonal tile contains a central white field filled with floral and animal motifs.  The tile is decorated with underlaze painting in cobalt and turquoise slips.  The surface of the glaze is somewhat degraded. The decoration extends from two painted ducks sitting at the bottom of the field.  Bent-stalked foliage with serrated saz leaves and heavy floral blossoms wrap around the ducks.  The borders of the tile contain a floral repeat pattern in dark blue glaze.,Fritware with underglaze painting,Hexagonal Tile with Birds amid Palmette Blossoms and Serrated Leaves,Not Recorded,"Elizabeth Ettinghausen (by 2006), promised gift; to Harvard Art Museums, 2006.",1520-1540,Department of Islamic & Later Indian Art,1540,,https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/316973,16th century,9.2006,"The Ottoman dynasty established the largest Islamic empire of the early modern era. At the peak of their powers in the sixteenth century, the Ottomans built numerous large architectural projects, especially in the capital city of Istanbul. Many of the projects were designed by the renowned head architect Sinan. Ceramic tiles were part of his carefully planned interior and exterior decorations. Working with court-supplied designs, potters in the city of Iznik created some of the world’s best-known and most coveted ceramics.
Ottoman tiles of the early sixteenth century, such as the hexagonal examples here, are indebted to earlier Persian tiles in their colors and shapes. In the 1550s, Ottoman potters developed an underglaze emerald green and a bright red that yielded a powerful palette visible at a distance. These colors, along with the newly developed modular square tiles, worked well for decoration that covered great expanses of wall. Larger, single tiles were used to highlight architectural elements such as doors and windows.",Ottoman,316973,H: 28.2 x W: 24 x Depth: 2 cm (11 1/8 x 9 7/16 x 13/16 in.)

Morris shows the destruction of land under a threatening sky bearing the words ""War Memorial""--titles of individual prints in the series include ""Trench with Chlorine Gas"" and ""Crater with Smoke.""  The prints are a direct reaction to the bombing of Cambodia by the American army and the images invoke death through destruction of land as a metaphor of war.  Morris became known in the 1960s as a minimalist sculptor and environmental artist.  In 1970, the year this series was created, he was instrumental in the withdrawal of nearly half of the participating artists from the American pavilion of the Venice Biennale in protest against US policies in South-east Asia, and closed his exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art in protest as well.  Morris also served as Chairman of ""Art Strike Against Racism, War and Repression,"" a group that organized the closing of museums and galleries in New York for a day of protest in 1970.

The location of Fragonard's painting of the same subject is currently unknown.  The etching complements the Fogg's pendant set of her paintings (which also involved Fragonard):  The First Steps, and The Beloved Child, each of which combines dogs or cats with a baby.  While these works may seem sentimental to modern eyes, their popularity reflects the renewed interest in childhood and the education of children brought about by the recent publication of Rousseau's Emile.

That 1960 work, ""Le collage de l'immortelle mort du monde,"" was among Filliou's first specifically visual works. Like its collaged antecedent, the published poster lays out, like a chessboard, a series of statements, color-coded and indexed both to emotional states and to performance directives.
Its relative complexity and overt theatricality-both in terms of staging and diction-differentiates Filliou's ""event score"" from the extraordinarily distilled examples produced by such peers as George Brecht (with whom he co-founded the gallery ""La Cedille qui Sourit"" in Villefranche-sur-Mer in 1965), La Monte Young, Dick Higgins, and other veterans of John Cage's famous ""Experimental Composition"" classes at New York's New School for Social Research in the late 1950s. By incorporating aleatory procedures into the temporal structure of the composition, Filliou creates a work that is, in Cage's terms, ""indeterminate with respect to performance."" But in its curious combination of the emotional, the philosophical, and the banal, Filliou's work attests not only to the impact of Cagean compositional models, but also to the continuing relevance of Existentialism in French intellectual and artistic culture of the late 1950s and early 1960s. In such ""scripted"" (the score allows performers the freedom to improvise) statements such as ""It is meaningless to say that…,"" ""Should I commit suicide because…,"" ""I'm here because I'm a man. Man is good."" and ""OK! OK! '…..'"" and in the absurdist rationality that governs the work's unfolding, Filliou enters into dialogue with the philosophical concerns of Samuel Beckett, and one can imagine Vladimir, Estragon, or Molloy among the cast of nine players performing Filliou's piece of ""auto-theater."" 
In addition to its individual worth, this work will add an important voice to HUAM's collection. Filliou was a major figure in Fluxus as well as in the French Nouveau Réalisme during the 1960s and 1970s. This work's 1960 date of conception gives it a ""proto-Fluxus"" status, while its publication by Something Else Press attests to the heterogeneity of the field of voices and approaches often conflated under the blanket term ""Fluxus."" Dick Higgins, who was one of the earliest Fluxus artists, founded Something Else Press as an alternative to Maciunas's Fluxus publications. And while they published works by many of the same artists, Higgins did not share Maciunas's uncompromising dedication to the replacement of the fine arts with the applied.",Photolithograph,"""Auto-theater"" poster published in 1967 by Something Else Press.

In 1565, Cornelis Cort produced highly popular engravings after Floris's cycle.  This print appears to be an engraving after Cort's engraving of Musica.  It differs from Cort in several ways, particularly in the title MVSICA and detailed floral pattern on the clavier, which appear in Cort's engraving, but do not appear in this print.  The inscription indicates Italian publishing: ""In Bologna Josefo Longhi below the stairs at the sign of S. Paolo.""  This inscription does not appear in any of the Floris catalogues or Hollstein.  Niccolò Nelli also published a copy of the series in Venice.  This print, however, is unnumbered and further deemphasizes the work's relationship to the set by removing the title, Mvsica, from the clavier.  In his Lives, Vasari recommended that Floris find himself a new engraver who could do his designs justice, which would seem to indicate he was unaware that this print was published outside of Floris's control by a Bolognese publisher.  This publisher, however, was keenly aware of the desirability of Floris's art in the southern market when he decided to re-engrave Floris's composition.

Although he has since become an internationally-recognized figure, the subject of monographic exhibitions at a host of institutions, these prints-produced in the early- to mid-1980s-represent a very different point in Pettibon's career. Both stem from Pettibon's close association with the southern California punk scene of the late seventies and early eighties, in particular the seminal band Black Flag and the record label SST Records (Black Flag guitarist and SST founder Greg Ginn is Pettibon's brother). 
Both prints-one a signed offset lithograph published in unknown quantity by SST, the other a photocopied flyer announcing a Black Flag gig-exemplify do-it-yourself attitude of the punk scene, which refused with equal vehemence the perceived elitism of high art and the repressive sameness of the ""culture industry"". The increasingly widespread photocopier became a powerful tool in the creation of an oppositional mode of cultural production, effectively turning any teenager into his or her own publishing house and any local bulletin board or wall into a space of oppositional display.
Both works testify to the pervasive sense of disquiet that marks Pettibon's oeuvre, which draws extensively on the forms and subjects of American popular culture and simultaneously exposes its darker undercurrents and desires. In the drawing for this Xeroxed flyer, Pettibon invests an image of a devil peering through a microscope with an ambiguous psychosexual charge. ""Turrrnnn offff thhe raaaadio…"" evokes the angst and anomie, and dissatisfaction with prevailing forms of cultural expression, that fueled the punk scene, especially as it moved into the conservative, middle-class suburbs of Orange County.

The artist has said that by juxtaposing these images he felt that he was implicating the white man in the lynching: ""I thought it was an image of guilt, an image of troubled sleep, a dream of something horrible that had happened; but it was also multi-layered, there was a piece missing in that puzzle about the crime, about what happened and what the story was, and it was left up to the viewer….Also, the sleeping man could have been dreaming, so there was the possibility that this was a racist fantasy or dream, which I felt gave the work its edge-but I think it brought up big problems too.""

The technique of printing in color à la poupée was perfected in the second half of the seventeenth century by the Netherlandish artist, Johannes Teyler, and examples of his color printing remain quite rare (although the Fogg has two in its collection). For this engraving, the printer inked in red the lines comprising the figures of the Virgin and Child, and then inked in blue the background architecture and the Dominican saints who surround her, thereby making mother and child the most emphatic elements of the composition. Such a print most likely had a domestic devotional function.

The hope was to carefully extract and preserve the design under more controlled laboratory conditions, but the fragments did not survive shipping intact.

Luckily, the designs had been copied by the excavation's architect Emmanuel Wilensky while still in situ, and these drawings represented the ruined wall paintings in exhibits for both the Fogg and Semitic Museums.

Her work includes explorations of the ways in which the war transformed traditional gender roles, the ideology of slavery, and the impact of the war’s enormous death toll, among other subjects.

To commemorate Drew Gilpin Faust’s inauguration as president of Harvard University, in 2007 the Art Museums exhibited this series. The installation of Walker’s prints was especially apposite to honor President Faust’s appointment. Faust is a leading scholar of the Civil War and the American South, and has written extensively on its history.

This monumental print, though of the same magnitude, seemingly does not present the same historically and socially potent subject matter. Instead, it represents a rather banal scene: six black men within a sparse domestic interior, chatting over food and coffee. The interior view unwraps from the exterior of the building, revealing the outside wall, as well as three inside walls. Its ""life-size"" height and length (8 x 50 feet) accentuates the impression that the print surrounds and envelops its viewers. It is exactly the prosaic character of the setting and the interactions between the figures that Marshall underscores. He defies our expectations of what a group of assembled black men will look like. The culture's lingering and imbedded racism, particularly as evidenced in its image culture, leads us to expect these men to be seen as oppressed, rebellious, or even dangerous. Instead, they simply intermingle in a very mundane way. Thus, the artist's depiction of ordinary men in run-of-the-mill surroundings engaged in an everyday activity serves to expose the viewers' own racism by calling to mind their own expectations. 
The domestic scene depicted by Marshall derives from the tradition of seventeenth-century genre scenes. Yet, he overturns the genre by populating it with a surprising cast of figures--thereby creating a genre out of a genre scene. The artist's acquaintance with and manipulation of the history of art is apparent throughout the image. Some of the figures' postures seem to reference poses from other renowned art works, i.e. the foreground figure on the left recalls the seated female from Manet's Luncheon in the Grass, as well as the reclining figure from the west pediment of the Parthenon. Marshall also references different genres of art making, such as the still life, landscape, and portraiture, both explicitly and overtly. Each of the darkened squares contain an obscured image-an example of each of these types of image making-overprinted with black, much in the same way he blackens the overall domestic scene. In this procedure is evident a willful blackening of visual culture and the history of art.",Woodcut,"This work is comprised of twelve woodcut prints, each sheet 8 x 4 feet.",Color woodcut with handcoloring,Untitled,Purchase,"Kerry James Marshall, Chicago, Illinois, to; [Jack Shainman Gallery, New York, New York], sold; to Harvard University Art Museums, August 2007.","1998, with 2007 additions",Department of Prints,1998,"[{'role': 'Artist', 'birthplace': 'Birmingham, Alabama', 'gender': 'male', 'displaydate': 'born 1955', 'prefix': None, 'culture': 'American', 'displayname': 'Kerry James Marshall', 'alphasort': 'Marshall, Kerry James', 'name': 'Kerry James Marshall', 'personid': 26402, 'deathplace': None, 'displayorder': 1}]",https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/320419,21st century,2007.129.A-L,,American,320419,"framed - overall (12 panels): 247 x 1501.1 cm (97 1/4 x 591 in.)

Romanelli gradually moved away from the full-blown Baroque exuberance of his master and Bernini--with whom he also collaborated--towards a slightly more sober and classicizing approach to form and composition. This more restrained manner served him well in France, where he was invited by Cardinal Mazarin to decorate the ceiling of his grand galerie (today the Galerie Mazarine of the Bibliothèque nationale de France, 1646-48), and later received a royal commission to decorate the ceilings of the apartment of the queen mother, Anne of Austria, at the Louvre (1655-57). Because of these successful commissions, Romanelli became a pivotal figure in the gradual acceptance of the Baroque in France, which would reach its apogee a generation later in the works of Le Brun at Versailles.

This drawing is related to a commission received from the Pope's nephew, Cardinal Francesco Barberini, in the late 1630s. Romanelli was asked to design a tapestry series depicting the story of Dido and Aeneas from Virgil's Aeneid for the cardinal's newly established manufactory. The drawing depicts the seventh of the eight scenes in the series that was woven under the direction of Michael Wauters from Antwerp (Aeneid, IV, 362-92). Only four complete sets remain.  Cartoons for six scenes are in the Norton-Simon Museum in Pasadena, and other related preparatory drawings are in: the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford; the British Museum, London; the Courtauld Institute, London; and the Kunstmuseum, Düsseldorf.",,,"Brown ink and brown and gray wash over black chalk on cream antique laid paper, partially squared in black chalk, partial framing line in brown ink, laid down on decorative mount",Aeneas Taking Leave of Dido,Gift,"Charles Rogers, London (his mark, Lugt 624, black ink, lower right) sale [Thomas Philipe, London, April 20, 1799, lot 547].

Respect and admiration for his talent eventually led to innumerable prestigious commissions and his elevation to the post of Principe of the Accademia Clementina (the artistic academy of Bologna). 

The supple contours and the replacement of cross-hatching with a subtle blending of chalks to achieve various levels of contrast makes this study a perfect example of why Monti's draftsmanship has often been viewed as the most eloquent example of the so-called soft-chalk style. A number of these studies, probably dating to the 1720s, once part of the Academia Clementina's teaching collection, are now in the Pinacoteca Nazionale in Bologna. The numbers at the bottom right of this sheet and on other drawings in this group--often misunderstood as the numbering of sketchbook pages--is almost certainly related to the classification system used to organize the drawings when they were in the academy's collection.

With relief decoration under a lead-fluxed green glaze, this cup continues a very long-lived and wide¬spread Roman tradition of fine ceramics. Wares of this type have been excavated from early Islamic sites in Egypt, Syria, Iraq, and Iran. The finely delineated palmettes and beaded borders recall Sasanian decorative motifs, suggesting an origin for this cup in the eastern lands of the early Islamic realm.

",8th century,Department of Islamic & Later Indian Art,799,,https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/322953,8th century,2007.264,"Following the Prophet Muhammad’s example, the Islamic polity, or caliphate, was ruled by a political and religious leader titled the caliph, or “successor” to the Prophet. Muslims eventually developed a monarchic system for controlling the succession of caliphs. The four centuries of the early Islamic era witnessed the establishment—and unraveling—of the universal caliphates of the Umayyad (661–750) and Abbasid (750–1258) dynasties. 

The range of the objects in this case illustrates the Islamic empire’s rapid expansion and the assimilation of peoples and artistic practices. A hot-worked glass vessel and a green-glazed pottery cup demonstrate continuity with late Roman traditions, while the figural imagery and inscriptions on tenth-century polychrome pottery vessels from eastern Iran underscore the continued vitality of pre-Islamic cultural traditions there. The creation of coinage bearing only inscriptions at the turn of the seventh century signals the unprecedented stature that Arabic calligraphy acquired, as the script itself became a symbol of the faith. Arabic inscriptions decorating ceramics produced in Central Asia proclaim the owner’s literacy and Muslim identity. ",Islamic,322953,"H. 7.9 x W. 17.5 cm (3 1/8 x 6 7/8 in.)

Eighteen were etched by the artist himself, although the majority are engravings made by a variety of printmakers. This compilation of portraits of princes, politicians, soldiers, statesmen, scholars, art connoisseurs and most importantly artists, a survey of the most distinguished men and women of his time, went through many editions. The edition published by Martinus van den Enden during van Dyck's lifetime consisted of eighty portraits. Van Dyck prepared these prints by making oil sketches and drawings in black chalk, sometimes washed with brown ink. 

Many of these eighteen etched portraits by van Dyck are rare first state impressions, including this one of the artist's Self-Portrait. The majority of the other eighteen are depictions of artists as well, including Jan and Pieter Brueghel, Lucas Vorsterman and Paulus Pontius-important reproductive engravers of Rubens's work, and Cornelis Anthoniszoon.

He entered Hampton University in Virginia in 1941 where he studied with Viktor Lowenfeld, the former curator of the Museum of African art in Vienna. He was also acquainted with Charles White and Elizabeth Catlett, prominent black artists teaching at Hampton. While he was still an undergraduate, one of Biggers' paintings was included in a landmark exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in 1943, Young Negro Art, establishing his reputation. After completing his Ph.D. in fine arts at Pennsylvania State University, Biggers took a teaching position at Texas Southern University where he started the art department. Although he reached a level of national artistic distinction, he experienced the inequity of racial difference throughout his life. Awarded notable prizes by the Houston Museum of Fine Arts and the Dallas Museum of Art in the 1950s, he was unable to attend the all-white prize ceremonies at the museums.

This lithograph of two women working in a field is characteristic of his work of the late 1940s and early 1950s which focused on black folkways.

After many years in Italy, he returned to Paris, where along with Laurent de La Hyre and Eustache Le Sueur, he became one of the founders of a classicizing style known as Parisian Atticism. The present work is an engraved interpretation of Stella’s celebrated drawing by Claudine Bouzonnet-Stella, the artist’s niece, who was one of the very few women connected with early French printmaking. 

This composition is frequently associated with Jacques Stella’s Passion of thirty scenes that was also engraved by Claudine, but the format and the severity of its design separates it from that endeavor. Instead, it must record another depiction of this popular theme. Although Claudine’s engraving is inscribed with the mention ‘pinxit,’ no commission or painting matching its description was listed in the inventory of Stella’s atelier, nor has it ever been mentioned by any of his biographers. Claudine’s engraving is also inscribed with the name of Nicolas Poussin as the inventor of the design. This indicates that it is the second state of the engraving, where Claudine’s name was replaced with that of the more famous artist. Claudine’s impressive suite of engravings after her uncle’s well-known Life of the Virgin series also suffered the same fate.

The fact that the quality of these compositions passed easily as works by Poussin can certainly be viewed as a compliment to Jacques Stella. However, the falsehood, which nearly obliterated the skillful printmaking oeuvre of Claudine, ought to serve as an important reminder that we should always examine the inscriptions we often assume to be incontrovertible. This particular deception for financial gain, first discovered and discussed by Jacques Thuillier and Anthony Blunt, is one of the first documentable French examples of what later became a familiar phenomenon, for by the second half of the seventeenth-century, Paris was well on its way to becoming the European center for interpretive printmaking, and compositions after Poussin -- the most distinguished French artist of the century -- were big sellers.",Engraving,,,Christ at the Column,Gift,,17th century,Department of Prints,0,"[{'role': 'Artist', 'birthplace': None, 'gender': 'female', 'displaydate': '1636 - 1697', 'prefix': None, 'culture': 'French', 'displayname': 'Claudine Bouzonnet-Stella', 'alphasort': 'Bouzonnet-Stella, Claudine', 'name': 'Claudine Bouzonnet-Stella', 'personid': 33108, 'deathplace': None, 'displayorder': 1}, {'role': 'Artist after', 'birthplace': 'Lyon', 'gender': 'male', 'displaydate': '1596 - 1657', 'prefix': 'After', 'culture': 'French', 'displayname': 'After Jacques Stella', 'alphasort': 'Stella, Jacques', 'name': 'Jacques Stella', 'personid': 28847, 'deathplace': 'Paris', 'displayorder': 2}]",https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/324144,17th century,2008.131,,French,324144,"sheet: 36.3 x 26.5 cm (14 5/16 x 10 7/16 in.)

Eighteen were etched by the artist himself, although the majority are engravings made by a variety of printmakers. This compilation of portraits of princes, politicians, soldiers, statesmen, scholars, art connoisseurs and most importantly artists, a survey of the most distinguished men and women of his time, went through many editions. The edition published by Martinus van den Enden during van Dyck's lifetime consisted of eighty portraits. Van Dyck prepared these prints by making oil sketches and drawings in black chalk, sometimes washed with brown ink. 

Many of these eighteen etched portraits by van Dyck are rare first state impressions, including the artist's Self-Portrait. The majority of the other eighteen are depictions of artists as well, including Jan and Pieter Brueghel, Lucas Vorsterman and Paulus Pontius-important reproductive engravers of Rubens's work, and Cornelis Anthoniszoon.

At the height of his career, Ommeganck captured a prestigious award at the Paris Salon of 1799 without even entering the competition, the Empress Josephine purchased one of his works every year, and his entire output was sold in advance. He played a leading role in the art schools and associations of Antwerp and belonged to the academies of Amsterdam, Brussels, Munich and Vienna. His contemporaries hailed him as the ""Raphael of Sheep"" and the ""Racine of Sheep""--flattering honorifics that sound ridiculous or satirical to us, but were certainly meant as the highest form of praise for an artist who specialized in pastoral scenes with prominent cattle.  

Ommeganck adapted the poetic, golden light, Mediterranean scenery, and idyllic mood depicted by Aelbert Cuyp and Dutch Italianate painters of the seventeenth-century, although he occasionally set his herdsmen and animals in the rugged landscape of Belgium's Ardennes. The latter views are based on careful observation. Like his Belgian contemporary Simon Denis-a fellow pupil in the studio of the Antwerp painter Hendricus-Josephus Antonissen-Ommeganck was a precursor of the nineteenth-century practice of making detailed studies from nature.   

""Rocky Landscape"" exemplifies this naturalistic approach. A gray-wash sketch that captures the lively play of light in a clearing beneath a rocky outcropping, it is the kind of  close study of an unprepossessing corner of the forest, clearly executed directly from the motif, that would become the norm for the next generation of landscapists.

This photograph is the formal living room of the Bose family of Howrah. The house is on Ramkrishnopur Lane which is across the Hooghly River from Calcutta. It was built in 1851 by Eshaan Chandra Bose who was the founder of the oldest stevedoring company in Calcutta. EC Bose and Company still exists and the Bose family still lives there in a joint family structure. My friend Modhurima Sinha's mother was born in this house as was her mother. Modhurima was the connection through which I was able to make these pictures in Calcutta. This space is particularly meaningful because it is her family's house. In the photograph you see a woman reflected in the glass over a painting at the far end of the room. The woman is Modhurima's mother and the painted portrait is her grandfather.

Zhang Huan has been a darling of contemporary Chinese art in the international art circles. Most media coverage has focused on his high-profile performance showcases. In fact, his woodblock prints, in my opinion, deserve more attention. This is one of a series entitled Memory Doors (2006).

As many of the rural Chinese households pulled down their old doors in exchange for the iron gates, Zhang collected a number of them from Shanxi in 2006. His assemblage of door slabs meshed with his long-time collection of old pictures. He then overlaid some of his old pictures over the surface of the door slabs and selectively carved areas into bas-relief. Prints were consequently produced from the carvings. The result is thoroughly refreshing. Zhang produced some of the most confounding compositions in contemporary Chinese art, at times surreal and oneiric, and always fiercely imaginative, which are very much in keeping with his long-time interest in transcendence, spirituality, and altered states of consciousness. Idiosyncratic and personal as these prints may appear, they have deep cultural resonances. They provide windows to ways of contemporary Chinese imagination and mental life. As befitting the print medium, these are the memory traces-hence, the title of the series, Memory Doors.

For each action the artist stood in a public street in New York City holding a sign that conveyed either a slogan from an actual historical protest (i.e. I am a Man) or an amalgam of protest language (Nothing will be as Before).  In each instance the artist alerted friends and fellow artists that she would be doing this activity and asked them to come and document the event. This documentation was subsequently transformed into slide form and was projected on the wall.  The ideal version of the installation sees the project in a linear form, with the images at different heights on the wall, resembling musical notes or words in a rebus-like sentence.
 
The work examines a host of ideas: the tenacity of American democracy's belief in the idea of free speech and assembly as hallmarks of our version of freedom, even as restrictions on speech and assembly have increased markedly in the years after 9/11.  The work also plays with the role of history, memory, and memorialization with regards to the history of protest movements for social justice. Indeed, the work suggests that such activities tend to defy memorialization and hence are subject to a very particular kind of erasure.  So too the work engages with the history of performance art, in particular the transitory nature of such work and its reliance on documentation and the ensuing debate about the precise role of that documentation-is it art or not etc. Here Hayes knows the work will exist only as documentation and plays with the interdependence of her actions (the performance) on others (friends taking pictures).

The works all began as part of a drawing project Sillman established for herself to draw portraits of couples she knew.  Using intimate friends as life models Sillman would both draw the couples ""as is"" as well as arrange them into various poses.  After this encounter she would return to the studio and then draw the couple from memory. Drawings would then proceed from the ""memory drawing"" until such a point that the drawing itself was almost, if not completely, abstract. These drawings ultimately became the basis for a series of abstract paintings-though there is no strong one-to-one correlation between individual drawings and paintings-rather what Sillman did was establish a set of rules and coordinates for making an abstract painting.  Hence the paintings themselves show no trace of their conception.  Rather they appear to be completely abstract, and their push-pull fields of color recall the gestural exploration of abstract expressionism-particularly the planes of Richard Diebenkorn and the palette of Willem DeKooning. Philip Guston's exploration of abstraction and political horror is another important touch stone for Sillman.  Sillman's earlier cartoonish style had a decidedly neurotic quality-pictures of small figures facing insurmountable odds.  In this series the emotional affect of awkwardness has been submerged into plays of color and abutting planes.  The paintings feel a bit like a dare or a question about whether or not its possible to make a meaningful abstract painting in the early years of 2000.  Can abstract escape the yoke of abstract expressionism? Can we talk about affect when there is no ostensible subject matter? Is there a legible grammar of painting?  Is there a politics and poetics of color and contemporary painting?  These are just a few of the questions Sillman's paintings pose.

Here depicted through a vaguely ominous mask with S/M associations and a tree branch shaped somewhat like a divining rod.  The rabbit appears on and off throughout Blake's now 20 year long career.  Sometimes the rabbit connotes a high developed sex drive, sometimes the cartoonish prat falls of Walt Disney's Bugs Bunny and sometimes the African American folk tradition of Br'er Rabbit.  All of these associations are meant, however contradictorily so, providing Blake's oeuvre with a layered set of meaning and connotations in the overlapping fields of sexuality and race.  His continued deployment of the motif of the rabbit can also be seen as the creation of a kind of self mythology in the tradition of Joseph Beuys, although rather then a self aggrandizing heroic narrative we are continually offered instead a version of masculinity and/or the artist in a state of benign disrepair.

Blake is known for his witty sculptures, almost all of which appear to be created out of almost negligible materials.  Working in the readymade and assemblage tradition, he transforms the mundane objects of everyday life into just barely legible sculptures, by which I mean his transformation of the everyday is never heroic, but rather often flirts with, and revels in, the pathetic and low nature of his materials.

Describing feelings of entrapment (she had begun her career as an artist in NY), Smith began to measure the contents and rooms of her domestic space.  Translating these measurements into thread, which she knotted obsessively, and tape measures Smith, who referred to these works as drawings, began to enact conceptual art's affection for measurement and precision within the domestic sphere.  Like Sylvia Plimack Mangold's paintings of her domestic interior these drawings explore the ""trick"" of perspective by showing the contradiction between actual measurement and the appearance of objects in space. Cleaving open the space between ""reality"" and ""representation"" can be seen in this context to have as much to do with Mel Bochner's exercises in measurement as they do with the feminist agenda of bringing reality and representation into a closer proximity to one another.  ""Stairs"" is a classic work of Smith's evoking not only receding space, but space upwards, as well as access to another plane (i.e. another floor). In this regard its play with space is quite fanciful-albeit lonely in their evocation of a staircase to nowhere. But the work also plays with the tradition of trompe l'oeil, tricking the eye into a belief in a space not present.  Despite the works playfulness, the emotional connotation of the work is vexed-the knotted thread speaks to a kind of obsessive, mindless activity (Smith was to make the analogy between knotting and housework) and the stairs (and other pieces of furniture meticulously made by Smith) have a kind of stark emptiness that subtly undermine the so-called American dream of a house in the suburb being the embodiment of fulfillment. In Smith's case it appears rather as an empty shell.

His work is usually large in scale and done with a simple graphite pencil. Interested in American social history and popular culture his work is exceedingly legible in terms of subject matter.  This drawing is one of a suite of 4 works entitled ""Questions for My Father.""  Each drawing is a list of personal questions, the kind usually only asked by adult friends and lovers of one another, but here Haendel has presented these questions as if to his Father. They are disarming and strikingly intimate, exposing the still taboo nature of father-son intimacy and closeness, stretching the boundaries of propriety by mixing the so-called personal and political together.  The questions speak to a kind of generational chasm, as well as to the profound unknowableness of the other, particularly those we assume are, or should be, most close to us.  This tension between public and private is exacerbated by the intensely hand made quality of the drawing, up to and including the artist's own ""copyediting"" of the questions, and the typewriter style precision with which the words and text are laid out on the page, seemingly with no guiding lines or erasure.  Like many artists of his generation, his work continues certain aspects of conceptual art-the use of language, a foregrounding of the artist's labor-but differs demonstrably from the arid or bureaucratic nature of conceptual art through its pursuit of emotional affect and handmade sensibility.

This indexicality ran counter to the somewhat bloodless vogue for appropriation that had dominated the art of the 1980s.  So too, Hodges's work, like that of many of his contemporaries, came of age in the midst of the AIDS crisis, that is in the middle of a desperate moment in which the art world lost literally thousands of its members to the devastating disease.  Like many gay artists of the period Hodges was involved in activist work to help stop the crisis but his art work forged a new version of political art, one suffused with a sadness, melancholy, and loss, rather then propagandistic calls to action or iterations of anger and rage (all of which were justifiable).  In this regard his work is very much in sympathy with that of Felix Gonzalez Torres, with whom he was friends.  

The Diary of Flowers was an ongoing work of Hodges's.  In a diaristic vein Hodges would draw flowers with a simple blue or black ball point pen on diner napkins every day.  When the work began he was working in an unheated studio and would go to the diner or coffee shop not only to eat but also to warm up.  He amassed literally hundreds of these drawings and began to assemble them in groups that were hung, delicately to the wall, one pin per napkin.  The work was seen by Gonzalez Torres who, apparently, fell in love with it.  Hodges gave a set of the drawings to FGT, who had them installed in his living space.  When FGT died due to complications from HIV/AIDS Hodges decided to stop making the Diary of Flowers drawings.  

The drawings are a touchstone for many of the ideas that Hodges would develop over the next 15 years. They are delicate and ephemeral, and as such resist the mandate of art to ""last forever."" Rather their fragility suggests the transient nature of life applies to art as well. They display his commitment to everyday materials, as he bestows upon them a kind of magical aura by transforming them into art.  They are an early indication of Hodges' ongoing interest in the natural world.  They are an indication of the sentiment and sentimentality that was to become a hallmark of Hodges's work.  So too they are a strong indication of the then nascent return to drawing on the part of many artists of the 1990s. The rigor of their daily production channels much of the logic of conceptual art, and the everyday materials partakes in the avant-garde's claim to broker the difference between art and life, and yet they firmly hold onto their place as sentimental art rather than a structural exercise, suggesting that in the face of enormous human suffering and loss the realm of affect and the emotions had to find a voice in the production of culture.",,An array of floral sketches on 51 napkins which are pinned to the wall when installed.

After studying at the National Academy of Design in New York under Charles Hawthorne in the 1920s, Johnson traveled to France where he began working in a less academic style. After a brief return to New York where he experienced intense racism, he returned to Europe in 1930 and began his travels through northern Europe-Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. He remained in Scandinavia until 1938 when political unrest prompted another return to New York. Exposure to the Expressionism of such northern European artists as Nolde and Munch had a lasting influence on his work. Upon his return to the US, Johnson took a WPA job teaching at the Harlem Community Art Center, where he was introduced to the technique of screen printing. (The FAP/WPA transformed screenprinting from a commercial practice to a fine art technique when it set up a workshop dedicated to the medium in New York City in 1938.)  Johnson's previous print work had all been woodcut, a favored technique of the Expressionists. His arrival in Harlem also initiated an interest in subjects related to African-American life in the US-agrarian southern life, black American heroes, battalions of black soldiers, religious imagery, and northern urban black life, especially centered on the Harlem Renaissance. Screenprinting provided him with a visual language to represent these subjects with renewed vitality. The flat areas of bold color that comprise the stylized figures and objects are distinctly modernist in appearance and subject.

Wittenberg",2009-04-01T16:11:19-04:00,Modern and Contemporary Art,,1786,2009.0,Drawings,,,"The trial(s) of reputed anarchists Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti and their subsequent execution mesmerized and inflamed the United States in the 1920s. The Italian immigrants, arrested in 1920 for the murder of a shoe factory paymaster and his guard, were executed in 1927. Many observers were convinced that the men were innocent and that the trial had been a travesty. In 1931-32, several years after Sacco and Vanzetti's death, Ben Shahn produced a series of twenty-three gouaches illustrating what he referred to as ""the passion"" of Sacco and Vanzetti. Shahn recalled: ""Ever since I could remember I'd wished I'd been lucky enough to be alive at a great time-when something big was going on, like the Crucifixion. And suddenly I realized I was. Here I was living through another crucifixion. Here was something to paint!""(1) 

""Judge Webster Thayer"" is one of the series of gouaches, which serve almost as ""snapshots"" in a kind of album of the narrative. Most (if not all) of them are based on newspaper photographs of the large cast of characters. Perhaps the most haunting images are those of the two men themselves: shackled together, heads tilted (""Bartolomeo Vanzetti and Nicola Sacco""), or chained to their guards (""Sacco and Vanzetti and their Guards""), Vanzetti sitting upright on a spindly chair. The gouaches also include posed views of Sacco's family (""Nicola Sacco's Mother and Father, in his Home in Torremaggiore, Italy; and his Nephew and Nieces,"" ""Nicola Sacco, His Wife, and their Son Dante,"" ""Sacco's Family after the Verdict""), witnesses who testified to their innocence (""Three Witnesses,"" ""Six Witnesses who bought eels from Vanzetti,"" ""Enrico Bastoni, Baker who bought eels from Vanzetti on the morning of December 24, 1919""), and even a view of Vanzetti's home town in Italy. There are images of the lawyers (""The Four Prosecutors,"" ""Attorney for the Defense, William G. Thompson"") and The Lowell Committee, a trio of three men (headed by Harvard's president A. Lawrence Lowell) convened to pronounce on the fairness of the trial. 

Judge Webster Thayer appears in two of the gouaches, perhaps because he presided over several of the sequence of trials. In this drawing he appears as a bust, with a granitic head supported by diminutive shoulders. The blotted quality of gouache or watercolor that defines his face and wrinkles is offset by the white gouache frosting that delineate his hair, eyebrows, moustache, and beard. The Fogg drawing appears to be based on a photograph of the judge.(2) Shahn used the same bust-length format for his portrait of the defense attorney William G. Thompson, whose damply stippled jacket provides an animated counterpoint to his inscrutable face, his eyes invisible behind his glasses, and Governor Alvin T. Fuller. In the second gouache, the judge, swathed in his robes, is shown with an open book. His visage is more aged, and his presence more ceremonial than in the more intense bust-length image. The judge also appears in the window of the courthouse in the large tempera painting, ""The Passion of Sacco and Vanzetti,"" 1931-32, now at the Whitney. 

Felix Frankfurter, in his lengthy discussion of the case in the ""Atlantic Monthly,"" wrote disapprovingly of Judge Thayer: ""I assert with deep regret, but without the slightest fear of disproof, that certainly in modern times Judge Thayer's opinion stands unmatched for discrepancies between what the record discloses and what the opinion conveys. His 25,000-word document [his opinion] cannot accurately be described otherwise than as a farrago of misquotations, misrepresentations, suppressions, and mutilations. The disinterested inquirer could not possibly derive from it a true knowledge of the new evidence that was submitted to him as the basis for a new trial.""(3) Thayer was widely reviled for his unabashed prejudice against immigrants and radicals. Matthew Josephson, critic for ""The New Republic,"" described Shahn's portrayal of Thayer as an equivalence of representation and moral character: ""Here is fishy, green-eyed, bony-faced, lantern-jawed Thayer, painted for all posterity in his hollow robes of justice….""(4)

The gouaches in the ""Sacco and Vanzetti"" series were exhibited at the Downtown Gallery in New York in April 1932, only a few years after the deaths of Sacco and Vanzetti. The exhibition was extremely popular with the public, attracting Italian immigrants and others who were not accustomed to the New York gallery scene. In October 1932, the works were exhibited at the Harvard Coop under the auspices of the Harvard Society for Contemporary Art (also included in the exhibition were ten works illustrating the Dreyfus Affair). Boston was the very epicenter of the whole affair, and President Lowell had been the chair of the Lowell Committee. Thayer's house had been bombed in September 1932 (he was not injured). According to the ""Harvard Crimson,"" ""although almost all of the pictures… merge on caricature, there is more of art than mere clever distortion in these gouaches. When the exhibit appeared at the Downtown Gallery… many were inclined to dismiss the whole of Shahn's work as comic-strip treatment of more serious topics, yet even the poignancy that speaks from each picture is testimony that there is something more permanent than grim humor here.""(5) 

Shahn revisited the subject of Sacco and Vanzetti twenty-five years after the trial in a cover illustration for ""The Nation"" (August 23, 1952). The drawing for the cover, which is in the Fogg collection (1956.184), is based on one of the gouaches in the 1931-32 series. Sacco and Vanzetti were also the subject of Shahn's mosaic mural at Syracuse University, installed in 1967.

Chorbachi's work reflects her extensive knowledge of Islamic art history and mathematics (she gained her PhD at Harvard ca. 1981) and ceramics. For many years, Chorbachi has taught in the ceramics studio of the Harvard Office of the Arts, and is currently teaching a course at MIT on mathematical systems in Islamic art.

With this series of tiles, the artist has developed a style for integrating script and vegetation and for exploring the synthesis between the two. In this particular modular series, the words, which initially dominate the tiles, gradually interlace with vegetal designs and geometric forms, permeating and eventually merging with this representation universe. According to the artist, the words of the Muslim profession of faith ""go out into the world.""

The inscription reproduces the Muslim profession of faith, followed by formulaic praise.  Written in a fluid and inventive thuluth script, the inscription translates as: ""There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is the messenger of God. May his glory be glorified.""

A landmark in eighteenth-century book arts, the five-volume publication gave its name to the genre of often lavishly illustrated travelogues that appeared in its wake in Europe and Britain. 

Although rich in cultural traditions and artifacts, in the mid-eighteenth century Naples and Sicily remained off the route of most grand tourists. From 1759 to 1761, Saint-Non traveled in southern Italy with Jean-Honoré Fragonard and Hubert Robert, and it was on the basis of their drawings that he initially undertook to produce an illustrated account of the treasures of the region. In 1777, he commissioned additional drawings, most of them executed by Desprez and Claude-Louis Chatelet. Desprez traveled to Sicily in May 1778 with Dominique Vivant-Denon--the future museum director, then a secretary in the French diplomatic service in Naples--whom Saint-Non commissioned to produce a text. They arrived in Palermo in time for the annual celebration of the feast of St. Rosalia in July--the event recorded in this watercolor. It depicts the large, ornate cars (floats) that constituted the centerpiece of the procession, surrounded by dozens of attendants and spectators, before the twelfth-century cathedral. Smoke from celebratory cannon-fire hangs over the crowd. The work displays Desprez's virtuosity at its best: the architecture and innumerable small figures rendered in minute detail, the smoke and clouds in a looser technique, and the teeming festivity recorded with a scenographic flair that predicts the artist's achievement as a designer of stage spectacles.

In the event, this view of the procession of St. Rosalia was not engraved for reproduction in the ""Voyage pittoresque."" Like many other Desprez watercolors of Naples and Sicily, this painstakingly wrought, pictorially finished composition was clearly intended as an independent work of art. A squared, ink-and-wash drawing of the cathedral and the empty piazza (Sweden, private collection) evidently served as a preparatory study for our watercolor.

Since the first time it was published, the woman depicted in this likeness has been identified as Sophie de Bawr (1773-1860). Writer, dramaturge, composer of opera, Bawr also has the distinction of being the first woman historian of music. An aristocrat by birth, Alexandrine-Sophie Goury de Champgrand is credited with running a notable salon in Paris and was friends with many notable women, among them the painter Elisabeth Vigée-Lebrun. In 1809, she married a Russian, Baron de Bawr. 
 
Boilly painted the portrait in trompe-l'oeil grisaille to emulate a print. The artist's decision to imitate a print is interesting on several levels. First, it flatters the sitter by presenting her in a widely-defused and easily reproduced medium. In so doing, the viewer assumes the sitter is a well-known and recognized person. Boilly is certainly also aware of the threat of print and other reproductive imagery (perhaps even developments in photography) to the practice of painting. He establishes the primacy of paint by producing a rival to another medium, and fooling the viewer into thinking that this is something other than what it is.

Numerous examples have been excavated at Seleucia on the Tigris and also at Babylon, mainly in the residential areas of these cities. The type may go back to Seleucid times, but its combination of Greek and Near Eastern features is characteristic of Parthian art, as well.

The statuette embodies the meeting of two artistic traditions. The nude, largely frontal representation of a woman follows the conventions established for Near Eastern images of female deities, such as Ishtar/Astarte. The reclining pose, on the other hand, is Greek. It was developed for male banqueters but also employed for certain female figures, such as Nereids lounging on sea creatures. This reclining woman may in fact have been shown at banquet, since several terracotta figurines with the same pose hold a cup in the left hand. 

The significance of the alabaster and terracotta images of reclining women has to be sought in a local context and remains disputed. It has been suggested that they represented the goddess Anahita and were used as fertility charms (mainly for the alabaster statuettes) or, alternatively, that they were tomb offerings related to notions of the funerary banquet (for the terracotta figurines). However, male recliners are more rare and few statuettes seem to come from tombs.
",Carved,"This small alabaster figure represents a nude reclining woman, her legs, back, and proper left arm draped in a mantle. Several features of the original figure are not preserved: the hair was added in stucco or bitumen, the eyes were inlaid, and details such as jewelry were rendered in paint. Both feet and the lower part of the proper left arm are lost (the break in the arm was cut and drilled in modern times to attach the statuette to a wooden base).",Alabaster,Reclining Woman,Purchase,"Rudolf Meyer-Riefstahl (1880-1936) and Elizabeth Titzel Riefstahl (1889-1986), New York, by descent; to their son, Rudolf Meyer Riefstahl II (1929-2011), Rochester, Massachusetts.

Some called for symbolic or religious understanding and were used in ritual, such as the Cycladic figure; others invited their viewers to reconstruct a narrative scenario, such as the Aphrodite binding her sandal; whereas yet others offered visceral aesthetic, sensual, and perhaps even tactile delight. One of the bodies here — Lachaise’s Woman Bending Backward — is not from the ancient world, but, like many other European and American works, depends very much on Greco-Roman models and ideals, even as it distances itself from them, for example with a pose not known from representations of women in antiquity.",Parthian,348823,L. 17.1 cm (6 3/4 in.)

Bronze or wooden sistra were shaken to produce a characteristic ""sesheshet"" rustling sound, which was said to imitate the rustle of papyrus leaves and believed to sooth or pacify the goddess. Faience sistra were not typically used for this purpose because their material could not create the desired noise. Instead, these objects were left as votive objects at temples and many bear dedicatory inscriptions of pharaohs on the handle or naos [1]. Faience sistra bearing the emblem of Hathor have been found in sanctuaries to the goddess where they were left by her devotees.

Quibell. The tomb was paved with limestone blocks. 360 faience ushabtis, and fragments of others, were recovered from the tomb. They comprised five types: 15 with a “very well modelled” horizontal inscription--of which this ushabti was one; 322 with a T-shaped inscription on the front of the body; 10 with 6 lines of inscription (presumably horizontal), “rudely made”; 5 with one line of inscription (presumably vertical); and 10 with no inscription, “rudely made.” All of those with inscriptions bore Nesbanebdjed’s name. Quibell suggested that the uninscribed ones, of which there were a large number of fragments, may have belonged to a burial discovered next to Nesbanebdjed’s, which is presumed to have been looted in antiquity.

However, the fragments were not original to each other. This composite or “pastiche” object has been disassembled and the fragments are now accessioned individually, as 2022.242.1 (head), 1 2022.242.2 (body), and 2022.242.3 (legs). The terracotta (clay) fabric of the body (2022.242.2) differs from that of the head (2022.242.1) and legs (2022.242.3): this is clear from X-radiography, which indicated that the materials were different (e.g., different density and inclusions). X-radiography did not clarify the relationship between the clay of the head and legs; visual inspection of the terracotta suggests that they, too, are different from each other.
Several scenarios are possible: (1) the fragments are from two or three different ancient figurines (a “pastiche” of ancient fragments); (2) one or two fragments (such as the legs) were made in the 20th century to complete the other fragment(s), which, in this scenario, would likely be authentically ancient, creating a mixed modern and ancient “pastiche”; (3) all fragments are modern.
When the pastiche figurine was disassembled and old fills were removed, it became clear that the breaks do not align tightly. However, the edges of the breaks at the neck and legs all seem to be clean, modern cuts; it is possible that broken edges were cleaned up in order to facilitate easier mending when it was assembled.
These figurine fragments are fairly typical examples of a category of figurines depicting a nude female figure with a “bird-like” face. These were made in the 2nd millennium BCE at sites across northern Syria (today’s eastern Turkey and northern Syria). Specifically, this figurine is in a form that comes from the region of the Orontes River. Such figurines are often interpreted as goddesses or divinities; the frequent depiction of breasts (not present here) and pubic triangles (present here) have encouraged interpretations of deities or domains of life pertaining to female sexuality and/or fertility. It is common for figurines of this type to be broken across the legs. It is not currently clear if this frequent breakage pattern is the result of intentional, perhaps ritual, breakage or merely indicates a common susceptibility of the figurines to breakage during use or deposition.
Further information on this type of figurine may be found in the following standard reference work (where falls into the category of Orontes Type MAI 2): Leila Badre. 1980.

These figurines—with their curious faces (sometimes deemed “bird-like”), elaborate headdresses, and emphatic hips—are puzzling. Examples like numbers 1–4 [1998.15.16; 1992.256.12.1–3; 2022.242.1–3; 1969.177.86.1–2] have been found across today’s northern Syria and southeastern Türkiye (Turkey) in sanctuaries and graves dating from the second millennium BCE. Their applied breasts and incised pubic triangles mark them as female, encouraging modern interpretations about fertility and sexuality. Number 5 [1953.118], likely made on the island of Cyprus, shows similar features, attesting to ideas about female bodies shared between distant but connected communities of the eastern Mediterranean and western Asia during the Bronze Age. 
Who exactly do they depict? Goddesses or worshippers? Both or neither? Any answers are complicated by wrinkles in their modern stories that raise a more urgent question: are these objects even ancient? 
All six figurines moved through the art market without documented findspots, making it difficult to interpret them or even assess their authenticity. Number 6 [1999.252] may be a modern forgery. And while numbers 2–4 [1992.256.12.1–3; 2022.242.1–3; 1969.177.86.1–2] arrived at Harvard as single objects, each, in fact, comprises several pieces that are not original to each other.

Amulets, plaques, and fibulae (safety pins) with the image of Pazuzu—often just his head—were used to ward off the female demon Lamashtu (who preyed upon women in childbirth and newborn children), to control disease-bringing winds, and likely also to protect against Pazuzu himself. For Assyrians, Babylonians, and other peoples of the ancient Middle East, the powerful demon fulfilled apotropaic functions and could be employed in healing rituals.

See Nils P. Heeßel, Pazuzu: Archäologische und philologische Studien zu einem alt-orientalischen Dämon (Leiden: Brill/Styx, 2002).",Carved,"A representation of the demon Pazuzu fills the entire front of this relief plaque of gray stone. The figure displays the standard features of this hybrid creature, mixing human, canine, bird, and other animal elements. Pazuzu has an almost square head with bulging brows and a broad mouth. He is flashing his teeth, which include four fangs, two at top and two below; the tongue peeks out in between. The missing nose likely was that of a dog, and the now abraded eyes would have been wide open. The beard is cropped short and indicated by strokes. The ears are human. Ribbed goat horns lie flat on top of the head.

Below the long, stringy neck are human shoulders and arms, with feline paws instead of hands. Pazuzu's proper right arm is raised; the left is lowered. From the demon’s back emerge finely feathered double wings. The hairy chest and narrow ribcage resemble those of a dog, while the short legs are that of a bird, covered in feathers at top and terminating in large claws. The tail is shaped like a scorpion; the small but erect penis appears to end in a snake’s head, as on other examples. Pazuzu stands on a row of scales representing mountains.

The plaque is missing the lower left corner. The stepped top is chipped. Other stone plaques of this shape have drill holes in the sides of the topmost part. These would have allowed suspension even if not fully drilled through. It is quite likely that this plaque, too, had such holes, which facilitated the breakage. Too heavy to be worn on the person as an amulet, the plaque could have been affixed to the wall of the room or building it was intended to protect. The prominent parts of the relief are abraded, chipped, and pitted; the back is heavily scratched but appears to have been blank.

The ancient town of Dura-Europos is located today near the modern village of Salihiyeh, Syria. Located in the Middle Euphrates region (on the west bank of the Euphrates River), Dura-Europos is set between the Syrian steppe to the west and the Mesopotamian plain to the east. This location put it on the borderlands between empires, a zone contested over centuries. Founded under the Macedonian Greek Seleucid empire around 300 BCE, it subsequently passed between Parthian empire (by the late second or early 2nd century BCE), the Roman empire (by around 165 CE, after which it became a military garrison town), and the Sasanian empire (whose invasion in about 265 CE destroyed it). The small but cosmopolitan town is especially famous for figural wall paintings in its religious spaces, which include many temples to local and nonlocal gods, a Jewish synagogue, a Christian place of worship, and a Mithraeum (a shrine for the mystery cult of the god Mithras).",Painted,"Pale green pigment on white gypsum plaster.

The female figure represented is likely a goddess. Though traditionally and frequently identified as either Demeter or Persephone, these female protomes are probably best understood as representations open to many identifications.[1] Objects like this were dedicated in sanctuaries as votive offerings; they were also sometimes deposited in graves.[2]

The rider wears a floppy cap and the sleeved top and trousers with lively patterns that had become the standard costume of easterners, both mythical and real, by the time this vessel was made. The figure’s gender is uncertain. If the face and hands were originally covered in added white, as with the griffin, it would be an Amazon. In Greek myth, it is the Arimasps, another eastern people, who fight griffins guarding gold at the far edges of the known world. Vessels of this type appear to show both Amazons and Arimasps grappling with griffins; as both were easterners in the Greek mind, the distinction may not have mattered much. The fact that many of these vessels were found in the northern Black Sea region suggests that the imagery was consciously employed by Athenian potters to target the market in an area associated with these legendary peoples—and that the actual local inhabitants embraced these depictions. 

The back of the pelike shows two young men draped into copious cloaks. The vessel’s rim has been repaired and some of its decoration is lost.

In Graeco-Roman mythological narratives and, specifically, in Latin poetry (e.g., Ovid, Metamorphoses 10.99-105 and Fasti 4.221-224; Catullus 63), Attis was a lover of Kybele: unfaithful to her, she drove him mad, and he consequently castrated himself; he then died, and Kybele resurrected him as her consort. This story formed the legendary basis for the priesthood of the cult of Kybele: the priests, the galli, were eunuchs and dressed in the “Phrygian” outfit of Attis.

The attribution of this fragment to the Hellenistic period (3rd to mid-2nd century BCE) is tentative. It is based on the identification of the plaster as probably calcite (lime plaster) and the presence of colorful pebble inclusions in this plaster. The excavators identified such plaster as coming from the poorly-preserved and poorly-understood ""the Early Palace,"" the structure on the citadel that lies under the so-called ""Citadel Palace"" or ""Second Citadel Palace,"" which is typically understood as having a Seleucid date of construction (around the second quarter of the second century BCE). By contrast, wall paintings from the Roman-period buildings at Dura appear to have used gypsum plaster without such pebble inclusions. The fragment's archaeological provenience (findspot) within the site is not verifiable, due to lack of documentation, but the material makes the earlier date likely, pending further research.",Painted,White (brown-yellow) plaster with large colorful inclusions.

The attribution of this fragment to the Hellenistic period (3rd to mid-2nd century BCE) is tentative. It is based on the identification of the plaster as calcite (lime plaster) and the presence of colorful pebble inclusions in this plaster. The excavators identified such plaster as coming from the poorly-preserved and poorly-understood ""the Early Palace,"" the structure on the citadel that lies under the so-called ""Citadel Palace"" or ""Second Citadel Palace,"" which is typically understood as having a Seleucid date of construction (around the second quarter of the second century BCE). By contrast, wall paintings from the Roman-period buildings at Dura appear to have used gypsum plaster without such pebble inclusions. The fragment's archaeological provenience (findspot) within the site is not verifiable, due to lack of documentation, but the material makes the earlier date likely, pending further research.",Painted,"Grey pigment on white lime (calcite) plaster, with large multicolored pebble inclusions. Grey ground.

This fragment mends (joins) with fragment 1940.97.79. Both fragments have beveled edges intended to evoke masonry draft lines (drafted margins). This scheme is consistent with what is generally termed the ""Masonry Style"" in Mediterranean wall painting, which gave molded plaster walls the appearance of stone architecture (ashlar masonry and marble veneering).

Samples of the pigments and plaster were taken and analyzed in the Straus Center in 2023. The results found the grey to be made of the following: calcium carbonate, gypsum, Egyptian blue, and possibly carbon black.

The attribution of this fragment to the Hellenistic period (3rd to mid-2nd century BCE) is tentative. It is based on the identification of the plaster as calcite (lime plaster) and the presence of colorful pebble inclusions in this plaster. The excavators identified such plaster as coming from the poorly-preserved and poorly-understood ""the Early Palace,"" the structure on the citadel that lies under the so-called ""Citadel Palace"" or ""Second Citadel Palace,"" which is typically understood as having a Seleucid date of construction (around the second quarter of the second century BCE). By contrast, wall paintings from the Roman-period buildings at Dura appear to have used gypsum plaster without such pebble inclusions. The fragment's archaeological provenience (findspot) within the site is not verifiable, due to lack of documentation, but the material makes the earlier date likely, pending further research.",Painted,"Grey pigment on white lime (calcite) plaster, with large multicolored pebble inclusions.

This fragment mends (joins) with fragment 1940.97.22. Both fragments have beveled edges intended to evoke masonry draft lines (drafted margins). This scheme is consistent with what is generally termed the ""Masonry Style"" in Mediterranean wall painting, which gave molded plaster walls the appearance of stone architecture (ashlar masonry and marble veneering).

Samples of the pigments and plaster were taken from fragment 1940.97.22 and analyzed in the Straus Center in 2023.

The ancient town of Dura-Europos is located today near the modern village of Salihiyeh, Syria. Located in the Middle Euphrates region (on the west bank of the Euphrates River), Dura-Europos is set between the Syrian steppe to the west and the Mesopotamian plain to the east. This location put it on the borderlands between empires, a zone contested over centuries. Founded under the Macedonian Greek Seleucid empire around 300 BCE, it subsequently passed between Parthian empire (by the late second or early 2nd century BCE), the Roman empire (by around 165 CE, after which it became a military garrison town), and the Sasanian empire (whose invasion in about 265 CE destroyed it). The small but cosmopolitan town is especially famous for figural wall paintings in its religious spaces, which include many temples to local and nonlocal gods, a Jewish synagogue, a Christian place of worship, and a Mithraeum (a shrine for the mystery cult of the god Mithras).",Painted,Yellow and orange pigment on white plaster.

The hindlegs do not seem to have been folded under the body but rather stretched out at back, which suggests that this object was not simply a statuette but the handle of a tool of some kind. Animal-shaped handles are more common in Western Asia than Egypt, and this handle likely dates to the time when Egypt was part of the Achaemenid Persian Empire in the sixth and fifth century, and again in the fourth century BCE. Achaemenid art also provides a parallel for the animal’s neckband with frontal pendant.

However, these two fragments were not original to each other. The clay fabrics of the two fragments do not match each other: this is clear from X-radiography, which indicated that the materials were different (e.g., different density and inclusions), as well as from visible inspection of the terracotta. Additionally, once the fragments were separated and the modern filling materials were removed, it was apparent that the breaks did not match.

The relationship between the fragments is not clear. Several scenarios are possible: (1) the fragments are from two different ancient figurines (a “pastiche” of ancient fragments); (2) one fragment (such as the legs) was made in the 20th century to complete the other fragment (which in this scenario would, presumably, be ancient); (3) both fragments are modern.

These fragments are fairly typical examples of a category of figurines depicting a nude female figure with a “bird-like” face. These were made in the 2nd millennium BCE at sites across northern Syria (today’s eastern Turkey and northern Syria). Specifically, this figurine is in a form that comes from the region of the Orontes River. Such figurines are often interpreted as goddesses or divinities; the frequent depiction of breasts (not present here) and pubic triangles (present here) have encouraged interpretations of deities or domains of life pertaining to female sexuality and/or fertility. 

It is common for figurines of this type to be broken across the legs. It is not currently clear if this frequent breakage pattern is the result of intentional, perhaps ritual, breakage or merely indicates a common susceptibility of the figurines to breakage during use or deposition.

Further information on this type of figurine may be found in the following standard reference work (where falls into the category of Orontes Type MAI 2):

Paris: Librairie orientaliste Paul Geuthner.",Handmade,"This object is a fragmentary, handmade terracotta figurine that depicts an anthropomorphic female figure, of which about three-quarters survives: the head, arms, torso, and the upper part of the legs are present.

The figure’s eyes are large and round, made of applied circular pellets indented with a pointed circular tool. A thin, vertical triangle projects as a beak-like nose. A round applied pellet is deeply indented on the forehead above the nose. No mouth is indicated. She wears a headdress above, extant as a lunate form. It is broken at the top; it, thus, is difficult to determine its original shape (circular, lunate, or flat on top, for example) and whether it was perforated. On either side of the face are a rounded projections with two round perforations, representing ears, part of the headdress, or hair.

A necklace decorates the base of her long neck; made of an applied strip of clay, it is decorated by a rouletted line. Stub arms project to either side from a violin-shaped body with wide, round hips. In the center of the torso, an applied circular pellet with a circular indentation forms a navel. The pubic area is outlined through incision with a horizontal line above and a curving line below; the lower line meets the vertical groove that delineates the legs. Preservation makes it difficult to discern how the pubic area was decorated (horizontal rouletting or other kind of incision?).

The figurine’s back is flat and undecorated except for two divots on the back of her hips and a vertical grove that delineates the legs, as on the front. This flatness is indicative of the forming process, in which the clay was pressed against a flat surface.

A break at the neck (likely occurring in modernity) has been mended.

However, the fragments are not original to each other. The terracotta (clay) fabric of the body (2022.242.2) differs from that of the head (2022.242.1) and legs (2022.242.3): this is clear from X-radiography, which indicated that the materials were different (e.g., different density and inclusions). X-radiography did not clarify the relationship between the clay of the head and legs; visual inspection of the terracotta suggests that they, too, are different from each other.
Several scenarios are possible: (1) the fragments are from two or three different ancient figurines (a “pastiche” of ancient fragments); (2) one or two fragments (such as the legs) were made in the 20th century to complete the other fragment(s), which, in this scenario, would likely be authentically ancient, creating a mixed modern and ancient “pastiche”; (3) all fragments are modern.
When the pastiche figurine was disassembled and old fills were removed, it became clear that the breaks do not align tightly. However, the edges of the breaks at the neck and legs all seem to be clean, modern cuts; it is possible that broken edges were cleaned up in order to facilitate easier mending when it was assembled.
These figurine fragments are fairly typical examples of a category of figurines depicting a nude female figure with a “bird-like” face. These were made in the 2nd millennium BCE at sites across northern Syria (today’s eastern Turkey and northern Syria). Specifically, this figurine is in a form that comes from the region of the Orontes River. Such figurines are often interpreted as goddesses or divinities; the frequent depiction of breasts (not present here) and pubic triangles (present here) have encouraged interpretations of deities or domains of life pertaining to female sexuality and/or fertility. It is common for figurines of this type to be broken across the legs. It is not currently clear if this frequent breakage pattern is the result of intentional, perhaps ritual, breakage or merely indicates a common susceptibility of the figurines to breakage during use or deposition.

The figural design is dark against a light background. At the center of the fragment is a running rabbit inside a medallion. The wide decorative border around the rabbit contains sections of delicate interlace (triple strand guilloche) with dots inside the lobes on all four sides, separated by vines and leaves at each corner. The vines and rabbit are outlined in buff thread and stand against false hatched backgrounds (false hatching creates a mottled effect by alternating light and dark threads in the weft. A crowstep border runs around the outside of the square. Supplementary weft wrapping ('flying shuttle') creates many of the vertical lines in the design (parallel to the warp direction), details of the rabbit, and the four dots outside the inner medallion. Strongly eccentric wefts can be seen in the curves of the figural design. The large slits to the right and left of the tapestry square are stitched closed. The square is inwoven with the warps grouped in the area of tapestry weave. Several pairs of self-bands, created by taking multiple threads together in the weft, decorate the areas of plain weave.

Monochrome tapestry-woven segments decorate what would have been a garment primarily made of plain woven, undyed fabric. The upper area of this fragment features four abstracted dancers between the columns of an arcade. A lunette sits above each opening; two of the lunettes contain an architectural; design while the other two feature figural busts. The arcade is made up of spiral columns with small Corinthian capitals. From the left, the first and third dancers are male and wear straps across their chests. The second and fourth figures are female and wear tunics and long scarves meant to accentuate their movements in the dance. 
The clavi bands surrounding the arcade scene contain fish, animals and plant life. The field is organized into three rows, of repeating motifs. The clavi form a continuous band that runs around the rectangle containing the arcade and dancers. In the upper horizontal portion of this band, the fish, animal, and plant motifs are arranged in two rows instead of the three used elsewhere. All of the fish and animals have the same orientation, as if a ground line runs on the right side of the tunic. This continuous band is edged with finials on most of its sides; at the very top edge of the tunic however there is a purple band with buff medallions containing small birds. A reinforced selvedge at the top marks the neckline of the tunic opening. 
Between the clavi bands is an expanse of plain woven undyed linen. A slit between a pair of warps near the arcade has been stitched closed. There are evenly distributed horizontal creases towards the bottom of the piece and a few tears in this area. 
Several neatly cut fragments in the upper left corner have been added or restored. In the fragment forming the right angle of the purple band, the warps are running in the wrong direction, clearly indicating this fragment does not belong in its current position. These discontinuous fragments may have been cut from another location on the tunic and added in here to create the appearance of completeness. Staining in the upper left area of the intact textile suggests that this portion had suffered damage in a burial context.

The largest, uppermost fragment consists of an arcade with four dark purple figures from a Dionysiac group standing under the arches. The leftmost figure is nude with a cap and holds a yellow staff topped with a green detail; this figure is likely Dionysus with his thyrsus staff. This green and yellow thyrsus is the only bit of color in an otherwise monochrome textile and serves to distinguish this first figure from the rest. On the right side of the staff are four purple dots. The same dots also appear under the raised arm of the final figure in the procession. The other three figures below the arcade take the traditional pose common to representations of dancers, with one arm raised and bent at the elbow. After the figure of Dionysus, going from left to right, we find a woman with a long, transparent peplos with one breast bared. This woman twists her body to look over her right shoulder. Next is a man either nude or wearing a loin cloth with some kind of implements at his waist, perhaps a shepherd’s crook. The last figure is a nude female striding to the right. Above her right hand and below her left are some purple shapes, perhaps instruments like castanets. All four figures glance to the right. Many details of these figures are articulated in an undyed supplementary weft in the ‘flying shuttle’ technique. Details of the arcade and animals are also created via flying shuttle. Surrounding the arcade on three sides is a border pattern of dark crow-stepped diamonds outlined in undyed wefts. This border transitions to the pattern of the clavi bands at about the figures’ waist height. Two large rabbits at the start of the clavi pattern also belong to this large fragment. A reinforced selvedge at the top edge of this fragment marks the neckline of the tunic. 
Rabbits, lions, and grape leaf motifs repeat down the sides. At bottom are a pair of segments with vertical stripes.","Wool and linen, tapestry weave",Fragments from a Tunic Front,Gift,"Dikran Garabed Kelekian, New York (by 1951), by descent; Mr. and Mrs. Charles Dikran Kelekian, New York (1951-1981), gift; to the Fogg Museum.",5th century,Department of Ancient and Byzantine Art & Numismatics,499,,https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/214511,5th century,1981.31,,Byzantine,214511,87.5 x 35.5 cm (34 7/16 x 14 in.)

The use of purple in textiles, whether true purple dye from the murex shellfish or imitations, was meant to signal wealth.","Woven, tapestry weave","Two inwoven tapestry woven bands run across this textile. The bands take the form of thick undulating vines with grape leaves occurring at regular intervals. Each leaf is preceded and followed by two or three grapes.

The vines are created with purple wool and undyed linen wefts.

The bands are set fairly close together, and so probably do not represent the clavi of a tunic. The textile may come from a furnishing—purple stripes were favorite motifs for furnishing textiles since Greek and Roman times—or another form of garment like a shawl. Furnishings from the domestic environment were often repurposed to wrap a body in a burial, and the staining on this textile confirms this use.

The inwoven slit tapestry square (tabula) introduces wool wefts. At center, a quail with red feet and beak sits within a dark blue circle with a gold inner border. Blue lines and dots create a sense of space with a ground line around the quail. Four smaller circles formed from vines sit within the corners of the square; these contain rabbits and lions with red and pink tongues in active stances. Each of these vine circles has just a single tendril. The four intervening spaces between the vine medallions are occupied by green fluted urns (kantharoi) sprouting thick blue vine stalks with green tendrils, blue grape leaves, and red and pink grapes. The grapes in the upper left corner of the square are pink, as is the tongue of the fearsome lion adjacent to them. The foot of the leftmost kantharos is a lighter shade of green than the green used in the rest of the textile. A dark blue border runs around the exterior of the square; at each corner a grape leaf extends, indicating that this border too is meant to be understood as a vine. A single gold dot appears in the upper border.

The ‘flying shuttle’ technique creates details on the urns, plants, and animals using buff and dark blue supplementary wefts. The tapestry square has several inches of plain/tabby woven linen on each side, likely to prevent the draping loops from falling across the square and obscuring its design. Slits on the left and right side of the square formed by the slit tapestry technique are stitched closed for stability. 

Supplementary wefts are pulled into loops over the surface of the linen ground weave at regular intervals. This forms rows of loops. The loops appear to be made using the slip loop technique.

For about a century, beginning in the late 1400s, Ottoman potters in the town of Iznik in western Anatolia produced what are arguably the finest ceramics in the history of Islamic art. Working with a white frit body and perfectly transparent glaze, Iznik potters experimented to expand the palette for their underglaze technique. Starting out with a blue-on-white scheme, they added turquoise in the 1520s. By the mid-1550s, they had perfected a dark black, brilliant red, and vibrant green, as can be seen on the floral dish in the case at right.

At the peak of their powers in the sixteenth century, the Ottomans built numerous large architectural projects, especially in the capital city of Istanbul. Many of the projects were designed by the renowned head architect Sinan. Ceramic tiles were part of his carefully planned interior and exterior decorations. Working with court-supplied designs, potters in the city of Iznik created some of the world’s best-known and most coveted ceramics.
Ottoman tiles of the early sixteenth century, such as the hexagonal examples here, are indebted to earlier Persian tiles in their colors and shapes. In the 1550s, Ottoman potters developed an underglaze emerald green and a bright red that yielded a powerful palette visible at a distance. These colors, along with the newly developed modular square tiles, worked well for decoration that covered great expanses of wall.

Four Tiles with Arabesque Design
Turkey, Iznik, Ottoman dynasty, c. 1560
Fritware with painting under glaze

The swirling energy of this arabesque disguises the simple geometry of its composition. Four foliate vines spin outward from each rosette to terminate by intersecting with vines from adjacent rosettes. Tiles with the same pattern decorate the back wall of the mosque of Rüstem Pasa in Istanbul, which was completed in 1561.
","Underglazed, painted","During the second half of the sixteenth century, a great profusion of colors and motifs begins to appear in the Iznik tiles. This tile, 9 1/2 inches square, features the traditional blue and turquoise on a white slip, but a bright orange has been added.  The rumi pattern spirals from one square to another and the glaze is thick, forming little mounds on the white slip.  Since these tiles are identical in pattern to those framing the doorway of the famous Rustem Pasha Mosque in Istanbul (built by the architect Sinan in 1560) we may assume  that they date from this period and may even have formed part of a consignment of tiles for the building.",Fritware,Tile with interlocking half-palmettes and rosettes,Gift,"Edwin Binney, 3rd, (by 1985), bequest; to Harvard University Art Museums, 1985.",c. 1560,Department of Islamic & Later Indian Art,1565,,https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/215764,16th century,1985.323,"The Ottoman dynasty established the largest Islamic empire of the early modern era. At the peak of their powers in the sixteenth century, the Ottomans built numerous large architectural projects, especially in the capital city of Istanbul. Many of the projects were designed by the renowned head architect Sinan. Ceramic tiles were part of his carefully planned interior and exterior decorations. Working with court-supplied designs, potters in the city of Iznik created some of the world’s best-known and most coveted ceramics.
Ottoman tiles of the early sixteenth century, such as the hexagonal examples here, are indebted to earlier Persian tiles in their colors and shapes. In the 1550s, Ottoman potters developed an underglaze emerald green and a bright red that yielded a powerful palette visible at a distance. These colors, along with the newly developed modular square tiles, worked well for decoration that covered great expanses of wall.

The King of Delhi, Descendant of a Schab, Whose Eyes Were Put Out in Ld. Clive’s Time When He Was Delivered up to the English; from an Album Entitled “Costumes of India”

Arthur M. Sackler Museum, Gift of Mrs. C. Adrian Rübel, 1979.346.27

“The King of Delhi” referenced in the painting, Shah Alam Khan II (r. 1759–1806), was blinded by Afghan Ghulam Qadir, who invaded Delhi in 1787. Qadir was not able to hold Delhi, however, and Shah Alam II continued to rule the city as a puppet of the British, who were not yet strong enough to claim dominance on their own, until his death in 1806.
  Part of an album of historical personalities, this painting reveals how the British wished to be perceived. The title “King of Delhi” in capital letters belies the wording below as well as the image above, subtly pointing to the king’s redundancy while amplifying the British position in India. Shah Alam II appears more as a humble ascetic than a Mughal king. Dressed simply and seated beside a Muslim tomb, he is perhaps in prayer. The spare setting and muted tones of the landscape lend an air of resignation.

Tombstone of Muhammad

Limestone; signed `Ali Ahmad al-Jarrad [or Kharrad] …

Many faiths propagate themselves across time and distance through texts that articulate belief systems and prescribe as well as proscribe certain behaviors. By contrast, the visual arts of a given culture sometimes reveal a different picture of how a particular faith is lived and experienced by its adherents. This limestone slab and the adjacent ceramic plaque do both: The inscriptions framing the top and sides of each object replicate verses from the Qur’an, Islam’s central text, and the beautifully carved inscription in an ornamental Arabic script identifies the stone slab as a qabr, or grave marker. The turquoise plaque was probably created for a mausoleum. The various schools of Islamic jurisprudence (fikh) are unanimous in disapproving of all tomb ornamentation. As the many decorated tombstones and mausolea throughout Islamic lands demonstrate, however, this was a law sometimes honored in the breach.

Within a few centuries of its invention in ninth-century Iraq, the complicated technique of creating lustered ceramics passed to Egypt, and then to Iran. A closely guarded trade secret, luster painting presumably migrated with families of potters, buffeted by political upheavals. The city of Kashan was the center of the luster industry in Iran during the Saljuq-Atabeg period. Despite the turbulence of the Mongol conquests, Kashan potters continued to produce brilliant luster designs into the 1300s.

Their shape tends to be assimilated to that of a bird by the addition of a crop at the neck and often also eyes. Buff examples with reddish-brown painted decoration comprising geometric motifs as well as animal figures are known from ""Cemetery B"" at Tepe Sialk, near Kashan on the Iranian plateau (for a recent publication discussing this site, see www.iranheritage.org/tsbook).",Wheel-made,"The vessel has a shallow foot with flat base. A slight edge marks the transition of shoulder to neck, which opens in a flaring mouth. A flat strap handle connects lip and shoulder. Opposite the handle is a spout terminating in a long, trough-shaped and tapering beak (the very tip appears to be missing). It is linked to the vessel’s lip by a small bridge of clay. The bird-like appearance of the vessel is reinforced by a crop on the “neck” of the spout, below the “beak.” Two raised points towards the rear of the vessel, one on each side of the handle, were perhaps inspired by bird anatomy or by the bosses covering rivets on metal vessels of similar shape.

The body of the vessel is fired buff to light reddish brown. Its surface is polished and painted with dark reddish-brown decoration. The most elaborate patterns occur at the transition to the spout, where a row of elongated triangles is reminiscent of a bird’s breast feathers. Other motifs include checkerboard and crosshatching. A large diamond filled with checkerboard decorates each side of the vessel, elongated triangles run along the beak-shaped spout, and wavy bands encircle the vessel’s mouth. The handle bears zigzag decoration with interspersed dots, the handle base is framed by volutes, and there is a diamond filled with dotted crosshatching below. On the vessel's interior, the lip is lined with dots, which also appear on the exterior at the transition from shoulder to neck and above the foot. The unpolished underside of the foot shows a sloppily painted cross with a dot in each quadrant, as well as smudged paint.

The vessel’s mouth and spout are reassembled from a number of fragments; some 40% of the lip are restored. The painted decoration is abraded where the vessel’s circumference is the largest.

The niches in the center of both this turquoise plaque and the adjacent tombstone reference a mihrab—the marker within a mosque that signals the qibla, that is, the direc¬tion toward the city of Mecca. Muslims are required to turn toward Mecca in prayer, and Muslim burial practices cus¬tomarily align the body with the qibla. The representation of the mihrab on the ceramic plaque—depicting a sanctuary lamp suspended from chains—is more pictorial than that on the tombstone. This imagery evokes sacred text without lit¬erally reproducing it, for it calls to mind a well-known verse from the Qur’an (24:35) that begins: “God is the light of the heavens and the earth.

In Hindi, doruah, the caption inscribed beneath this painting, means “dog keeper”—literally, one who holds a leash (dor). Dressed in elegant livery—a tightly bound dhoti and coat—the dog keeper comfortably holds the leashes of three dogs of European origin.
  Created in sets, such typologies of occupations offered insight into Indian society and were popular gifts to send home to friends and family in England. In increasing numbers, Company officers engaged local artists to make paintings of their servants and of stock characters outside British cantonments, or military stations.
  Indian artists adapted to European tastes in style as well as subject. The pale, translucent washes appear at first glance to mimic British watercolor technique. However, they are built up with small, visible strokes, a feature of traditional Indian miniature painting.

Portraits of Five Seated Englishmen
Kota, Rajasthan, India, 19th century
Opaque watercolor on paper
Arthur M. Sackler Museum, The Stuart Cary Welch Collection, Gift of Edith I. Welch in memory of Stuart Cary Welch, 2009.202.259

These two drawings offer a satirical view of the British through an Indian lens, as local artists responded to the growing presence and influence of the English in the time of the Crown Raj. Two European Men in White Hats portrays dandies with brilliant blue eyes and large ears, clad in pith helmets and white suits. Whereas earlier generations of British merchants and officers had adopted Indian ways, Company officers often wore full English dress despite the wilting heat in India.
  Portraits of Five Seated Gentlemen may either be poking fun at its subjects or simply the whimsical result of a hybrid style. The men, wearing Western dress, are in mid-conversation, perched awkwardly on their chairs, legs askew. The pink tones of their faces are rendered sensitively in gouache technique, which was used widely in Mughal painting. But the artist’s attempt to convey three-dimensionality and volume reflects the growing interest in European style.

Bankers Receive News from
a Dak Runner
India, c. 1850
Opaque watercolor and gold on paper
Arthur M. Sackler Museum, The Stuart Cary Welch Collection, Gift of Edith I. Welch in memory of Stuart Cary Welch, 2009.202.219

In this painting Hindu bankers from the village of Nourie are seated on a flat-weave indigo-dyed carpet, at work at their ledgers, while a dak runner (mailman) stands by with a letter. The inscription reads: “A Hukurah [dak runner] delivering a letter to Shraffs [bankers] of Nourie Hindoos.”
  The painting highlights the social distinctions between the humble dak runner, dressed in dingy colors, and the wealthy bankers garbed in saffron turbans, snow-white robes, and coral prayer beads. Coifing the bankers in saffron adds a touch of irony: in Hinduism, saffron is associated with then sacred as well as renunciation of the material world.
",,"Seated on a flat, white and indigo carpet are three Hindu bankers (shraffs) from the village of Noori, located in the Chandauli District of Uttar Pradesh State in India, working on their ledgers. The bankers wear red-orange turbans, white robes, and red-beaded necklaces. The one on the left has a distinct, long beard, and his large stomach is exposed. Standing next to this figure is a mail (dak) runner, distinguished by his spear and the messages in his hand. Mail runners not only delivered important messages, but also news from neighboring villages.  The painting highlights the social distinctions between the bankers and the mail runner, as the latter is dressed more humbly in a sooty top and a dhoti, a garment worn by male Hindus, consisting of a piece of fabric tied around the waist and extending to cover most of the legs. The runner also wears a red-orange turban with a white band tied around it.",Opaque watercolor and gold on paper,Bankers Receive News from a Dak Runner,Gift,"Stuart Cary Welch (by 1983 - 2008,) by descent; to his estate (2008-2009,) gift; to Harvard Art Museum.

The Zamorin of Calicut
Southern India, mid-19th century
Opaque watercolor on paper
Arthur M. Sackler Museum, The Stuart Cary Welch Collection, Gift of Edith I. Welch in memory of Stuart Cary Welch, 2009.202.249

One of the earliest Indian seaports, Calicut cultivated its wealth from the trade in spices, textiles, and hardwood. By the nineteenth century, the chiefs of the city’s ruling house of Tampuran were key players in East Indian trade networks. In this full-figure portrait, the Tampuran ruler Zamorin asserts his affluence and elevated status by surrounding himself with opulent adornments such as the heavily carved marble-mounted chair, velvet drapery, and fine carpets. His gaze extends beyond the viewer. The painting shows a confluence of styles; the artist used both the opaque watercolor that is a traditional Indian medium and the translucent washes favored by Europeans. The variation between thin silks and heavy velvets conveys dimensionality, with an attention to volume and perspective that situates the work within the Crown Era, with its increasing appropriation of European style.

The most popular themes for Roman sculpture were deities and emperors. These statues were often idealized, meaning that they did not necessarily represent the emperor or ruling family to the exact detail. Sometimes emperors preferred to be depicted as younger, larger, or more intimidating than they actually were. The same problem is found with deities; these statues were imagined, idealized images of fictional beings, so no two statues are going to be the same. However, because of the long tradition of stone work the Romans had to build upon, many characteristics remain the same. We can infer that Roman artists projected a shared view of humanity upon their sculpture, and by looking at the work modern audiences are able to glean insight into how Romans looked or at least how they wanted to be seen.  

Sculpture in the Roman world was most often executed in marble. However, this goddess statuette is made of alabaster, which helps in identifying its provenance as Egypt.

Early instances of the pattern are monochromatic, white lozenges outlined with black borders and simple black filler designs (2). During the late second and early third century CE, the floors become more elaborate with polychromatic fillers such as those found in the lozenges of the Samarian pavement. In some second and third century pavements, the designs also exhibit an increased tendency towards illusionism with shading in the lozenges and the filling ornaments, as can be seen in an early third century CE pavement from the House of the Drinking Contest at Antioch (3).

This pavement was found in the north colonnade of the Stadium at Samaria (4).

",,"One of four panels from a large, square floor pavement with geometric design and inscription (2016.53.4). The overall geometric design consists of lozenges pieced together at the corners to create smaller squares (the ‘lozenge-star-and-square pattern’) which radiate around a larger, central square (1). The lozenges are delineated by black borders and filled alternately with yellow and orange tesserae. The four small squares contain geometric filling ornaments: two Solomon’s knots and two rainbow patterns. A large square in the center is filled with a four-petalled, white flower on an orange background. A triple border surrounds the central geometric panel and consists of a guilloche (braided ribbon) in shades of orange, black, and white; a crowstep pattern in black; and a plain black band (2).

The Greek inscription may name a patron responsible for funding the mosaic or the building in which it was located. Inscriptions sometimes occur in public or religious buildings to attest to a patron’s responsibility for the creation of a pavement or larger building project. The text is most often in Greek or Latin although in later pavements of the Syria-Palestine region it may be in Hebrew or Aramaic, most often in religious buildings (2). In some instances, the inscriptions become the central element of the pavement, often at the doorway or threshold into the space (3).

These all date from approximately the last quarter of the sixth century B.C.E. (c. 530-500). The theme of Heracles as a musician found only on this group of Athenian vases in early Greek art, although it does reappear in later periods.

Following John Boardman, scholars generally agree that the popularity of the Heracles-as-musician scene type should be associated with the reorganisation of Athens’ great annual festival to Athena, the Panathenaia, to include musical competitions and recitals of Homer by the tyrant Peisistratos and his sons. Other examples of the scene type (e.g. Boulogne 78, BAPD 320179) include the detail of Heracles stepping up onto a platform, which more directly evokes the festival performance context. 

This interpretation is further strengthened by one example of the theme (Tarquinia 679, BAPD 39) where Heracles, holding his lyre, approaches a burning altar behind which stands Athena. This detail suggests that the motif of Heracles as musician is associated with the worship of Athena, with the Panathenaia being her single most important festival at Athens. Exactly what context we should imagine Heracles is performing in, however, is not obvious, especially given his divine but variable audience, and we cannot assume that it is in any literal sense the Panathenaia.

The significance of Heracles in particular occupying the role of musician is not entirely clear, but it may reflect the centrality of the hero in the Athenian tyrants’ propaganda. In any case, the scene type situates Heracles as a hero who embodies both athletic and musical excellence and thereby the ideal of a well-rounded Athenian education.

These depictions are somewhat at odds with the more usual conception of Heracles as a particularly uncultured and unartistic warrior; on a somewhat later cup (skyphos) attributed to the Pistoxenos Painter (Schwerin 708, BAPD 211358), for example, a scene of Heracles’ half-brother Iphicles studiously practicing on the lyre with his teacher is pointedly contrasted with a scene on the other side depicting Heracles holding a spear with his back turned to an old woman holding a lyre, presumably encouraging the reluctant hero to practice like his brother. We should also think of the story that Heracles killed his music teacher Linus in a fit of rage in frustration at his lack of musical ability (depicted, for example, on a cup attributed to Douris, Munich J371, BAPD 205174).

Each of the figures wears armor and a helmet, and carries a shield and a spear. Added red and white are used for some details, like the greaves, helmet crests, shield bands and insignia, and clothing, although some of this added color has been lost.

On the body: Heracles stands left of center, and faces towards the right, holding a kithara (lyre). He holds a plectrum attached to the body of the instrument by string in his right hand. He wears his characteristic lion skin, decorated with flecks to indicate its fur, over a short tunic (chiton), and he also carries a bow and quiver and a sword in a scabbard. Added red is used for the lion’s mane and Heracles’ tunic; added white is used for arrow-heads at the top of the scabbard, the lion’s teeth, the sword handle and parts of the kithara. 

In front of Heracles and facing him stands the goddess Athena. She is identifiable by her helmet and snake-covered aegis which she wears over a long dress (peplos). Her helmet extends beyond the frame into the scene on the shoulder. She carries a long spear. Her skin is painted in white, indicating that she is a woman; added red is used to decorate her aegis and skirt.

Behind her stands the bearded god Hermes, who is identifiable by his traveller’s cap (petasos) and cloak (chlamys), winged shoes, and staff (caduceus). Added red is used to decorate the brim of his hat, his cloak and shoes as well as his beard.

Behind Heracles is another woman, who may be Hebe, the goddess of youth, and Heracles’ third and final wife. She wears a cloak (himation) over a long dress (peplos) and holds two long leafy branches. Her skin is painted in added white to indicate her gender, and added red decorates her clothing.

Upon crossing the threshold into an Indian temple, worshippers are greeted by a myriad of deities. From the Gupta period (third–early sixth century) onward, the jambs on either side of the door have often been decorated with groups of figures set into stacks of architecturally ornamented registers. These groups frequently depict divine couples, known as mithuna, which are represented in the smaller panel to the right. The figures on the left panel appear to include combinations of mithuna, apsaras (celestial females), and a donative scene of two women making offerings to a male ascetic figure, possibly a form of the god Shiva or one of his devotees. These divine beings are considered auspicious, and their presence on doorways is said to secure blessings and protection for the sacred space inside.",,,Red sandstone; from Rajasthan,Architectural Relief with Figures (Fragment of a Column),Gift,"Mr. and Mrs. Howard E.

Architectural Relief with Kali Dancing on Reclining Shiva
India, Madhya Pradesh, possibly Khajuraho, 10th–11th century
Light red sandstone
Arthur M. Sackler Museum, Gift of Mr. and Mrs. Howard E. Houston, 1974.64

Legs bent in movement, arms swirling with a cascade of weapons, the great goddess Kali dances upon the prostrate body of the god Shiva. Her emaciated body points to her fierce nature and her association with ghosts and other dan¬gerous beings. Kali is the one of the most powerful forms of devi, the goddess, in the Hindu tradition. In the sixth-century text the Devi Mahatmya, Kali emerges from the forehead of the goddess Durga in order to fight two powerful demons. She is worshipped throughout India, and particularly in the eastern state of Bengal, where she is regarded as a great, divine mother. This stele sculpture was likely created for the external niche of a central Indian temple and may have come from the Chandella dynastic capital of Khajuraho.

Chamunda is a wrathful emanation of the Hindu goddess Kali and has both destructive and protective aspects. As related in the sixth-century text the Devi-Mahatmya, Chamunda takes her name from two demons, Chanda and Munda, whom she vanquishes in a great war. Here an emaciated body with an exaggerated rib cage conveys the insatiable hunger of the goddess, while human skulls and entwined snakes testify to her terrifying power. Sometimes the goddess stands on Shiva, who subdues her anger.

These were made in the 2nd millennium BCE at sites across northern Syria (today’s eastern Turkey and northern Syria). Specifically, this figurine is in a form that comes from the region of the Orontes River. Such figurines are often interpreted as goddesses or divinities; the frequent depiction of breasts (present here) and pubic triangles (not present here) have encouraged interpretations of deities or domains of life pertaining to female sexuality and/or fertility. 

It is common for figurines of this type to be broken across the legs. It is not currently clear if this frequent breakage pattern is the result of intentional, perhaps ritual, breakage or merely indicates a common susceptibility of the figurines to breakage during use or deposition.

Further information on this type of figurine may be found in the following standard reference work (where falls into the category of Orontes Type MAI 2): 
Leila Badre. 1980. Les figurines anthropomorphes en terre cuite a l'age du bronze en Syrie, Bibliothèque archéologique et historique 103. Paris: Librairie orientaliste Paul Geuthner.",Handmade,"This handmade terracotta figurine depicts a anthropomorphic female figure. She is naked except for a necklace or collar around her neck and a belt or sash around her waist. Four rounded projections, perforated (pierced all the way through), create a comb structure that frames her face, indicating a headdress, an elaborate coiffure, or ears. Eyes are large and round, formed of applied circular pellets which were indented by a circular tool; another perforated pellet was applied at the center of her forehead. Her forehead and nose are formed by a thin, tall rectangular piece of clay, giving her face a beak-like appearance (the basis of the “bird-like” descriptor often applied to figurines like this). Her necklace is formed out of a roll of clay decorated with two lines of rouletting. 

Her arms project as short stumps to either side of her body. Her breasts are indicated by applied circular pellets indented by a circular tool. Her navel is formed in the same way. A belt or sash is formed on the front of her body by an applied roll of clay that runs below her navel; two ends dangle down onto her legs. Fine rouletted piercings in horizontal lines decorate the belt/sash.

Her hips widen in a diamond-like shape. Her legs, which taper, are delineated on front and back by a vertical line, likely a result of their formation by two rolls of clay. Her back is flat, save the line separating her legs; this is also indicative of the forming process, in which the clay was pressed against a flat surface. While her pose is a “standing” posture, the figurine would not have been able to stand upright on its own: her feet point downward and do not provide a flat, stable resting surface. Two rouletted lines decorate the top of her feet, apparently indicating toes.

A break (mended) runs from the middle of the proper right leg across through the proper left leg, as a slight upward diagonal; there is a small loss from the front surface on the proper right leg. Another break, running from the proper left shoulder below the proper right arm, has also been mended.",Terracotta,Anthropomorphic female figurine,Bequest,"William A. Koshland, New York (by 1997), bequest; to Harvard University Art Museums, 1998.",1900-1800 BCE,Department of Ancient and Byzantine Art & Numismatics,-1800,,https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/212079,18th century BCE,1998.15.16,"Of Fragments and Forgeries 
These figurines—with their curious faces (sometimes deemed “bird-like”), elaborate headdresses, and emphatic hips—are puzzling. Examples like numbers 1–4 [1998.15.16; 1992.256.12.1–3; 2022.242.1–3; 1969.177.86.1–2] have been found across today’s northern Syria and southeastern Türkiye (Turkey) in sanctuaries and graves dating from the second millennium BCE. Their applied breasts and incised pubic triangles mark them as female, encouraging modern interpretations about fertility and sexuality. Number 5 [1953.118], likely made on the island of Cyprus, shows similar features, attesting to ideas about female bodies shared between distant but connected communities of the eastern Mediterranean and western Asia during the Bronze Age. 
Who exactly do they depict? Goddesses or worshippers? Both or neither? Any answers are complicated by wrinkles in their modern stories that raise a more urgent question: are these objects even ancient? 
All six figurines moved through the art market without documented findspots, making it difficult to interpret them or even assess their authenticity. Number 6 [1999.252] may be a modern forgery. And while numbers 2–4 [1992.256.12.1–3; 2022.242.1–3; 1969.177.86.1–2] arrived at Harvard as single objects, each, in fact, comprises several pieces that are not original to each other. It is not clear whether the fragments are all ancient, all modern, or a combination of both. Displayed here disassembled, the objects offer a cautionary tale about the uncertainty that accompanies poorly documented paths on the art market.",Syrian,212079,H. 16 × W. 5.5 × D. 3.5 cm (6 5/16 × 2 3/16 × 1 3/8 in.)
