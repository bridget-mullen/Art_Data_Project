The artist’s title, however, accords him only the designation of his race, using the language of that historical moment.

Beazley (1885-1970) as the “Negro Alabastra Group” which all depict an image of a black warrior standing alone. The oil flask (alabastron) is typically considered to be a feminine object for feminine usage and is thought to have held scented perfumes or other similar kinds of substances. The shape and white-ground background are where it gets its name, the latter is believed to have been imitate the appearance of alabaster, out of which more expensive alabastra would have been made. 

Scholars have debated on how to interpret the images of black warriors on such vessels: are they intended to represent a particular group of black warriors, like the warriors of Memnon from the Iliad? Are they a reference to black warriors fighting for the Persians as described by Herodotus? Though both of these hypotheses are possible, especially the latter considering the time period (early fifth century BCE.) in which they were made. However, it cannot be said for sure since the visual evidence of any specific contexts is lacking on the actual vessels.

 Another issue of interpretation is what these images have to do with the vessels on which they are painted. The warriors are often juxtaposed with images of a palm tree, as here, or of an Amazon, a female warrior generally connoted as foreign and non-Greek. One line of interpretation is that the images are intended to evoke a sense of exoticism, possibly referencing the far-off places from which the vessel’s contents - likely perfume - originated. Even if latter association is somewhat questionable, it is true that the images generally portray the “other.” Building on this reading is the fact that these vessels never depict the ideal Greek male citizen either as a hoplite (citizen warrior) or otherwise. Thus, as François Lissarrague argues, the feminine vessels coupled with the exotic imagery are intended to represent the realm of “the other,” which in Classical Greek society meant women and foreigners.

He entered Hampton University in Virginia in 1941 where he studied with Viktor Lowenfeld, the former curator of the Museum of African art in Vienna. He was also acquainted with Charles White and Elizabeth Catlett, prominent black artists teaching at Hampton. While he was still an undergraduate, one of Biggers' paintings was included in a landmark exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in 1943, Young Negro Art, establishing his reputation. After completing his Ph.D. in fine arts at Pennsylvania State University, Biggers took a teaching position at Texas Southern University where he started the art department. Although he reached a level of national artistic distinction, he experienced the inequity of racial difference throughout his life. Awarded notable prizes by the Houston Museum of Fine Arts and the Dallas Museum of Art in the 1950s, he was unable to attend the all-white prize ceremonies at the museums.

Both objects were produced during the British campaign to abolish slavery. An active abolitionist movement persisted in Britain because owning enslaved people was not outlawed until 1833, with its final abolishment in 1838. Ceramics such as these would have been sold at abolitionist gatherings, providing ways to support the cause. The display of these wares on the table was intended to prompt a sympathetic visual response from those who used them. 

These objects have smooth, clear ceramic bodies, with beautiful glazes and gilding, but their images evoke horror. The front of the jug shows a man in bondage, and the back of the jug features stanzas from William Cowper’s influential poem “The Negro’s Complaint” (1788), written from the perspective of an enslaved man. The emblem on the butter tub presents an enslaved woman set against a background with a palm tree. This tropical setting directly references the labor of enslaved people responsible for sugar production in the Caribbean.
