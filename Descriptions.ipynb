This painting is part of a four-folio scene, which, combined, would create a large battle painting. It is possible that this folio, along with the other three, was made sometime after the Dispersed Bhagavata Purana series was completed to accompany the series. There is no text on the reverse of this folio. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis painting belongs to the 'Dispersed' Bhagavata Purana series, produced in the early 16th century, possibly in Mathura. The series, possibly consisting of 360 such folios, is based on the tenth book of the Bhagavata Purana, which describes the story of Krishna, particularly his childhood and youth. This series was one of South Asia's earliest illustrated Bhagavata Purana manuscripts.

It illustrates a trend toward realism in Greek portraiture of the third century BCE and offers a posthumous psychological interpretation of the eloquent but ill-fated champion of Athenian liberty against Macedonian dominance. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\n",

Instead of the characteristic row of tall flowering plants, there is a repeat pattern of staggered rows of a highly stylised floral sprig, with a short stem, a leaf and a flower head.

The fish on the left is shown in profile, with a green body that is darker at the top and then fades to a cream-colored abdomen. The fish on the right is depicted from both a profile and top view. This distinct perspective simultaneously highlights the fish's eyes, the demarcations on its back, and its flared abdomen.  The fish is gray with light and dark blue stripes on its back. The lower half of its body is dark gray which fades to a white abdomen. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere are inscriptions in pen and pencil in the right third of the composition, behind the fish.  These inscriptions are oriented vertically, like the album itself. An inscription identifies the fish as “Putka”. Another inscription states, what appears to be “Tetradon”. This could be referring to the family, Tetradontidae. It is possible that the fish represent the species Arothron reticularis from this family, a reticulated puffer fish that is found on the east coast of India.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis work falls into the genre of natural history documentation, an important enterprise undertaken by many European patrons during their time in India.

It is teardrop shaped, with a round head and tapering tail. The fish has two round eyes and a curved, triangular snout.  It has a continuous row of lateral fins that extend the entire length of the body and taper into the tail.  It is light brown in color with some mottling. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe page has inscriptions in ink and pencil the lower third of the composition.  One inscription identifies the fish as “Pan”, which most likely is referring to Brachirus pan, a type of sole native to the Indo-Pacific. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis work falls into the genre of natural history documentation, an important enterprise undertaken by many European patrons during their time in India.

This painting is part of a four-folio scene, which, combined, would create a large battle painting. It is possible that this folio, along with the other three, was made sometime after the Dispersed Bhagavata Purana series was completed to accompany the series. There is no text on the reverse of this folio. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis painting belongs to the 'Dispersed' Bhagavata Purana series, produced in the early 16th century, possibly in Mathura. The series, possibly consisting of 360 such folios, is based on the tenth book of the Bhagavata Purana, which describes the story of Krishna, particularly his childhood and youth. This series was one of South Asia's earliest illustrated Bhagavata Purana manuscripts.

       "      <td>Carved in gray limestone in Thailand in the seventh or early eighth century, this stone sculpture depicts the head of a Buddha, probably the Buddha Sakyamuni, the Historical Buddha; the face displays a serene, benevolent countenance. No images of the Buddha were created during his lifetime (traditionally, 563-483 BCE), so all representations, whether in painting or sculpture, are fanciful, presenting the imagined appearance of the Buddha; thus, the facial characters vary from culture to culture and from period to period. Broken from a stone statue of the Buddha—presumably a standing image of the Buddha—this sculpture includes the figure’s head and neck. The sculpture is presented frontally and, in form, is basically an elongated, vertically oriented rectangle. The facial features are relatively large, the down-cast eyes fully-modeled, lightly outlined, and set in shallow sockets below the narrow forehead and above the fleshy cheeks; appearing below the prominent nose, the thick, decidedly outlined lips turn up at the ends, imparting a slight smile to the mouth. Typical of sculptures influenced by Indian, Gupta-period sculptures from Sarnath (and ultimately by earlier sculptures in Gandharan style), the eyebrows are created less through modeling than through the crisp intersection of forehead and eye-socket planes. Three relatively deep intaglio lines encircle the neck, creating the characteristically fleshy folds that are described in Buddhist texts. A mound-shaped ushnisha appears atop the head, the ushnisha being the cranial protuberance symbolizing the expanded wisdom that the Buddha gained at the time of his Enlightenment and thus serving as the single and most-important defining iconographic characteristic of a Buddha. Snail-shell curls of hair arc across the top of the forehead and cover the entire crown of the head, including the ushnisha. The ears, with their distended lobes, are proportionally long but cling tightly to the sides of the head, the lobes flaring out lightly at the bottoms. The front and sides of the sculpture are in excellent condition, given the age of the piece; those portions are intact and complete. In fact, those portions show only various small nicks and scratches, apart from a chip on the proper left cheek—slightly above and to the (viewer’s) right of the end of the mouth—and apart from a long crack that extends from the bottom of the chin, through the just-mentioned chip and the proper left eye socket, across the forehead, and to the hairline. A small chip and related crack appear in corresponding positions on the proper right side of the face. In contrast to the well-preserved front and sides of the sculpture, most of the lower half of the back of the head is missing. The loss extends from the middle of the back of the head down to the bottom of the neck; the loss begins immediately after the first column of snail-shell curls of hair behind the figure’s proper right ear; the loss begins after the third column of curls behind the proper left ear, with the fourth column partly intact, partly missing. Fortunately, the ears and distended lobes are completely intact and undamaged. The chips and long cracks on the front of the sculpture likely were inflicted long ago, once the sculpture was no longer under worship; perhaps the sculpture fell over and was damaged. It is unknown when the head became detached from the body or when the lower portion of the back of the head was broken away. Like virtually all Buddhist sculpture in stone and clay, this image originally would have been painted, though no traces of either pigment or gesso ground remain today.</td>\n",

The last column of calligraphy on the (viewer's) left includes a date that corresponds to 1874 in the Gregorian calendar-that is, the letter is dated to the twentieth eighth day of the eighth lunar month of the kap-sul (Chinese, jiaxu) cyclical year, which corresponds to 1874. The letter paper comprises three vertical columns: buff (viewer's right), white (middle), and cranberry red (left). The buff column displays very subtle embellishment, probably a floral motif woodblock-printed in buff ink. It is probable that each column of paper originally was a separate sheet and that a collector pasted the three sheets together to form a single sheet. In fact, those portions of the letter on buff and white paper (i.e., right and middle portions) make sense when read together, just as their calligraphic style--and particularly the generous spacing of the characters--is virtually identical. By contrast, the contents of that portion on red paper (i.e., left portion) does not easily link with the contents of the other two portions; in addition, the characters are written very close together. The last-named element suggests either 1) that a page is--or several pages are--missing from the letter (and that Yi Ha-ung wrote the last page rather quickly, trying to squeeze everything onto one page) or 2) that the portion on red paper (i.e., left portion) might be from another letter and subsequently was joined to two pages from a different letter. Either possibility makes sense; probably we'll never know the exact situation. In any event, all three portions are from Yi Ha-ung's hand and all seem to date to the same period.</td>\n",

This painting is part of a four-folio scene, which, combined, would create a large battle painting. It is possible that this folio, along with the other three, was made sometime after the Dispersed Bhagavata Purana series was completed to accompany the series. There is no text on the reverse of this folio. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis painting belongs to the 'Dispersed' Bhagavata Purana series, produced in the early 16th century, possibly in Mathura. The series, possibly consisting of 360 such folios, is based on the tenth book of the Bhagavata Purana, which describes the story of Krishna, particularly his childhood and youth. This series was one of South Asia's earliest illustrated Bhagavata Purana manuscripts.

It illustrates a trend toward realism in Greek portraiture of the third century BCE and offers a posthumous psychological interpretation of the eloquent but ill-fated champion of Athenian liberty against Macedonian dominance. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\n",

Instead of the characteristic row of tall flowering plants, there is a repeat pattern of staggered rows of a highly stylised floral sprig, with a short stem, a leaf and a flower head. The patka falls into the category of textile art.\n",

The fish on the left is shown in profile, with a green body that is darker at the top and then fades to a cream-colored abdomen. The fish on the right is depicted from both a profile and top view. This distinct perspective simultaneously highlights the fish's eyes, the demarcations on its back, and its flared abdomen.  The fish is gray with light and dark blue stripes on its back. The lower half of its body is dark gray which fades to a white abdomen. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere are inscriptions in pen and pencil in the right third of the composition, behind the fish.  These inscriptions are oriented vertically, like the album itself. An inscription identifies the fish as “Putka”. Another inscription states, what appears to be “Tetradon”. This could be referring to the family, Tetradontidae. It is possible that the fish represent the species Arothron reticularis from this family, a reticulated puffer fish that is found on the east coast of India.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis work falls into the genre of natural history documentation, an important enterprise undertaken by many European patrons during their time in India.

It is teardrop shaped, with a round head and tapering tail. The fish has two round eyes and a curved, triangular snout.  It has a continuous row of lateral fins that extend the entire length of the body and taper into the tail.  It is light brown in color with some mottling. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe page has inscriptions in ink and pencil the lower third of the composition.  One inscription identifies the fish as “Pan”, which most likely is referring to Brachirus pan, a type of sole native to the Indo-Pacific. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis work falls into the genre of natural history documentation, an important enterprise undertaken by many European patrons during their time in India.

From top to bottom, starting with the upper register, the objects can be identified as a grape bunch over a crescent moon, tongs, two amphorae or kantharoi flanking three distaffs (for spinning) above an owl, and a four-spoked wheel; in the second register, there is a distaff with wool wound around it, a club, trident, distaff, caduceus, patera or offering bread, lighting bolt, scabbard, torch with flame arching to the right, and a ladder-shape, possibly an Apulian sistrum (a type of musical instrument). In the third register, there are three round offering cakes, a wavy symbol that could be a bow or serpent or cuttlefish above a square tablet, a lyre above an open hand, a bird (an eagle or a dove) facing right above an infinity symbol (either an open box mirror or cymbals) above a strigil or Egyptian sistrum, next to two difficult to read objects, of which one might be an oil flask.\\r\\n\n",

It demonstrates a warped-face plain weave.\n",

The side panels, with floral patterns on a white ground, are of a somewhat rare design. Although the forms are relatively simple, the number and saturation of the colors indicates an early date. It illustrates a warp-face plain weave.\n",

The exceptionally suffused color and vibrant, but pure green make this an example of a high level expertise in dyeing. This object illustrates a warp-faced plain weave.\n",

The fish is painted different shades of blue and has metalic pigment used to create the shiny surface of the fish's body. It appears to be a black Indian pomfret.\\r\\nThe bottom fish is smaller in size and longer in proportion than the top fish.  It has a lozenge shaped body with two dorsal and abdominal fins, a lateral fin, and a long, chevron shaped tail.  The bottom fish is striped in blue, green, and brown color with metalic pigment that replicates the shiny body of the fish.  This fish appears to be a kind of perch.\\r\\nThere are small patches drawn next to the fish where the artist tested out pattern strokes for making scales.

In one ikat type, the stylized floral figures are enclosed within attenuated diamond forms, in the other ikat pattern, more rounded floral forms are enclosed within white ovals of faceted geometric forms.

It has a pointed snout and its dorsal and abdominal fins are near the end of the body cavity, next to the base of the tail. Company School. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe page contains marks in pencil and ink above and below the fish. The inscriptions identify the fish as Macrognathus pancalus, a barred spiny eel, which is a freshwater fish native to southern Asia. The term “gainchie” has been erroneously inscribed on the paper; it refers to “Ganchi”, or Macrognathus aculeatus, the lesser spiny eel. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis work falls into the genre of natural history documentation, an important enterprise undertaken by many European patrons during their time in India.

It features a blunt, curved head with large eyes and a downward, curving, agape mouth. Its body tapers to a narrow tail. It has two dorsal fins, including a tall, spiny fin at the center of its back. The fish has a small lateral fin and an abdominal fin that both taper near the tail. Its tail is club-shaped. Its body is dark gray with darker gray and brown mottling. Its abdomen is a light gray. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe page has inscriptions in pen and pencil in the lower third of the composition, to the left and right of the fish, and along the bottom of the sheet. One inscription identifies the fish as “Manua”, while another appears to state “Gobius Plenianus”. The fish is most likely from the Gobiidae family, and perhaps represents the Amoya madraspatensis, a ray-finned fish that can be found in the eastern Indian Ocean. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis work falls into the genre of natural history documentation, an important enterprise undertaken by many European patrons during their time in India.

The animal has a long, thin torso; its upper fore- and hindlimbs are comparatively muscular. There is a raised ridge, indicating the spine, that runs from the neck, down the back, to the slight nub of a tail. The neck curves markedly to the left, while the body leans to the right. The head is simple, with little detail visible; bulges for the eyes and ears are apparent. The elongated muzzle flares at the end, and there is a semi-circular incision to indicate the opening of the mouth. It has two, long curving horns, now bent to cross each other.\n",

A lake occupies the painting's middle ground; low, rolling hills topped by deciduous trees separate the far edge of the middle ground from the background, which features distant mountains. Written in four columns, the artist's inscription appears in the upper right corner. Two seals of the artist accompany the inscription: a rectangular, red, intaglio seal appears at the beginning of the inscription, and a square, red, relief seal reading \"Tu San\" (the artist's sobriquet) appears at the end.\n",

The steep walls rise rapidly to the shoulder, where they curve inward and then angle upward to complete the container portion.  A bowed neck stands atop the shoulder, its lip turned delicately outward. A short spout in the form of an open-mouthed creature juts upward from the top of the shoulder; opposing the spout is a handle in the form of a slender, leaping lion with hind paws resting on the vessel shoulder and forepaws reaching over and grasping onto the vessel lip. The lion's head and shoulders rise above the top of the vessel and his jaws clamp down onto the edge of the lip, as if it were biting its prey. A thin, even coat of ivory-hued glaze covers the ewer's interior and exterior, stopping no more than a centimeter above the foot, so that the flat base and very lowest portion of the vessel remain unglazed. The exposed body clay is pure white.\n",

The composition is contained within a double-line circle, which is itself surrounded by a border sporting ten lightly incised decorative scroll motifs. The bottom section of the box is unembellished; the underside of the box reveals a countersunk foot. A grayish green glaze covers the entirety of the box, inside and out, with the exception of the circular rims where the two halves of the box meet and patches within the countersunk foot, where spurs were presumably placed in order to raise the vessel slightly during firing and prevent it from fusing to kiln furniture.\n",

The overall geometric design consists of lozenges pieced together at the corners to create smaller squares (the ‘lozenge-star-and-square pattern’) which radiate around a larger, central square (1). The lozenges are delineated by black borders and filled alternately with yellow and orange tesserae. The four small squares contain geometric filling ornaments: two Solomon’s knots and two rainbow patterns. A large square in the center is filled with a four-petalled, white flower on an orange background. A triple border surrounds the central geometric panel and consists of a guilloche (braided ribbon) in shades of orange, black, and white; a crowstep pattern in black; and a plain black band (2). \\r\\n\\r\\n1.

       "2314  Carved in gray limestone in Thailand in the seventh or early eighth century, this stone sculpture depicts the head of a Buddha, probably the Buddha Sakyamuni, the Historical Buddha; the face displays a serene, benevolent countenance. No images of the Buddha were created during his lifetime (traditionally, 563-483 BCE), so all representations, whether in painting or sculpture, are fanciful, presenting the imagined appearance of the Buddha; thus, the facial characters vary from culture to culture and from period to period. Broken from a stone statue of the Buddha—presumably a standing image of the Buddha—this sculpture includes the figure’s head and neck. The sculpture is presented frontally and, in form, is basically an elongated, vertically oriented rectangle. The facial features are relatively large, the down-cast eyes fully-modeled, lightly outlined, and set in shallow sockets below the narrow forehead and above the fleshy cheeks; appearing below the prominent nose, the thick, decidedly outlined lips turn up at the ends, imparting a slight smile to the mouth. Typical of sculptures influenced by Indian, Gupta-period sculptures from Sarnath (and ultimately by earlier sculptures in Gandharan style), the eyebrows are created less through modeling than through the crisp intersection of forehead and eye-socket planes. Three relatively deep intaglio lines encircle the neck, creating the characteristically fleshy folds that are described in Buddhist texts. A mound-shaped ushnisha appears atop the head, the ushnisha being the cranial protuberance symbolizing the expanded wisdom that the Buddha gained at the time of his Enlightenment and thus serving as the single and most-important defining iconographic characteristic of a Buddha. Snail-shell curls of hair arc across the top of the forehead and cover the entire crown of the head, including the ushnisha. The ears, with their distended lobes, are proportionally long but cling tightly to the sides of the head, the lobes flaring out lightly at the bottoms. The front and sides of the sculpture are in excellent condition, given the age of the piece; those portions are intact and complete. In fact, those portions show only various small nicks and scratches, apart from a chip on the proper left cheek—slightly above and to the (viewer’s) right of the end of the mouth—and apart from a long crack that extends from the bottom of the chin, through the just-mentioned chip and the proper left eye socket, across the forehead, and to the hairline. A small chip and related crack appear in corresponding positions on the proper right side of the face. In contrast to the well-preserved front and sides of the sculpture, most of the lower half of the back of the head is missing. The loss extends from the middle of the back of the head down to the bottom of the neck; the loss begins immediately after the first column of snail-shell curls of hair behind the figure’s proper right ear; the loss begins after the third column of curls behind the proper left ear, with the fourth column partly intact, partly missing. Fortunately, the ears and distended lobes are completely intact and undamaged. The chips and long cracks on the front of the sculpture likely were inflicted long ago, once the sculpture was no longer under worship; perhaps the sculpture fell over and was damaged. It is unknown when the head became detached from the body or when the lower portion of the back of the head was broken away. Like virtually all Buddhist sculpture in stone and clay, this image originally would have been painted, though no traces of either pigment or gesso ground remain today.\n",

The last column of calligraphy on the (viewer's) left includes a date that corresponds to 1874 in the Gregorian calendar-that is, the letter is dated to the twentieth eighth day of the eighth lunar month of the kap-sul (Chinese, jiaxu) cyclical year, which corresponds to 1874. The letter paper comprises three vertical columns: buff (viewer's right), white (middle), and cranberry red (left). The buff column displays very subtle embellishment, probably a floral motif woodblock-printed in buff ink. It is probable that each column of paper originally was a separate sheet and that a collector pasted the three sheets together to form a single sheet. In fact, those portions of the letter on buff and white paper (i.e., right and middle portions) make sense when read together, just as their calligraphic style--and particularly the generous spacing of the characters--is virtually identical. By contrast, the contents of that portion on red paper (i.e., left portion) does not easily link with the contents of the other two portions; in addition, the characters are written very close together. The last-named element suggests either 1) that a page is--or several pages are--missing from the letter (and that Yi Ha-ung wrote the last page rather quickly, trying to squeeze everything onto one page) or 2) that the portion on red paper (i.e., left portion) might be from another letter and subsequently was joined to two pages from a different letter. Either possibility makes sense; probably we'll never know the exact situation. In any event, all three portions are from Yi Ha-ung's hand and all seem to date to the same period.\n",

This painting is part of a four-folio scene, which, combined, would create a large battle painting. It is possible that this folio, along with the other three, was made sometime after the Dispersed Bhagavata Purana series was completed to accompany the series. There is no text on the reverse of this folio. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis painting belongs to the 'Dispersed' Bhagavata Purana series, produced in the early 16th century, possibly in Mathura. The series, possibly consisting of 360 such folios, is based on the tenth book of the Bhagavata Purana, which describes the story of Krishna, particularly his childhood and youth. This series was one of South Asia's earliest illustrated Bhagavata Purana manuscripts.

It illustrates a trend toward realism in Greek portraiture of the third century BCE and offers a posthumous psychological interpretation of the eloquent but ill-fated champion of Athenian liberty against Macedonian dominance. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n   \n",

Instead of the characteristic row of tall flowering plants, there is a repeat pattern of staggered rows of a highly stylised floral sprig, with a short stem, a leaf and a flower head. The patka falls into the category of textile art.   \n",

The fish on the left is shown in profile, with a green body that is darker at the top and then fades to a cream-colored abdomen. The fish on the right is depicted from both a profile and top view. This distinct perspective simultaneously highlights the fish's eyes, the demarcations on its back, and its flared abdomen.  The fish is gray with light and dark blue stripes on its back. The lower half of its body is dark gray which fades to a white abdomen. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere are inscriptions in pen and pencil in the right third of the composition, behind the fish.  These inscriptions are oriented vertically, like the album itself. An inscription identifies the fish as “Putka”. Another inscription states, what appears to be “Tetradon”. This could be referring to the family, Tetradontidae. It is possible that the fish represent the species Arothron reticularis from this family, a reticulated puffer fish that is found on the east coast of India.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis work falls into the genre of natural history documentation, an important enterprise undertaken by many European patrons during their time in India.

It is teardrop shaped, with a round head and tapering tail. The fish has two round eyes and a curved, triangular snout.  It has a continuous row of lateral fins that extend the entire length of the body and taper into the tail.  It is light brown in color with some mottling. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe page has inscriptions in ink and pencil the lower third of the composition.  One inscription identifies the fish as “Pan”, which most likely is referring to Brachirus pan, a type of sole native to the Indo-Pacific. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis work falls into the genre of natural history documentation, an important enterprise undertaken by many European patrons during their time in India.

From top to bottom, starting with the upper register, the objects can be identified as a grape bunch over a crescent moon, tongs, two amphorae or kantharoi flanking three distaffs (for spinning) above an owl, and a four-spoked wheel; in the second register, there is a distaff with wool wound around it, a club, trident, distaff, caduceus, patera or offering bread, lighting bolt, scabbard, torch with flame arching to the right, and a ladder-shape, possibly an Apulian sistrum (a type of musical instrument). In the third register, there are three round offering cakes, a wavy symbol that could be a bow or serpent or cuttlefish above a square tablet, a lyre above an open hand, a bird (an eagle or a dove) facing right above an infinity symbol (either an open box mirror or cymbals) above a strigil or Egyptian sistrum, next to two difficult to read objects, of which one might be an oil flask.\\r\\n   \n",

It demonstrates a warped-face plain weave.   \n",

The side panels, with floral patterns on a white ground, are of a somewhat rare design. Although the forms are relatively simple, the number and saturation of the colors indicates an early date. It illustrates a warp-face plain weave.   \n",

The exceptionally suffused color and vibrant, but pure green make this an example of a high level expertise in dyeing. This object illustrates a warp-faced plain weave.   \n",

Several are known, found in Italy, particularly in the south and around ancient Taras/Tarentum (Taranto). Some are in relief, but most have the symbols impressed into the disk.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe disks often bear many of the same motifs, some arranged in similar configurations from object to object. The objects may represent divinities--some common associations like Zeus with the thunderbolt, Hephaistos with the tongs, Poseidon with the trident, Hermes with the caduceus, Apollo with the lyre, and Athena with the owl are very clear--but many are in fact everyday items that are not necessrily associated with any particular god or goddess. They may, therefore, represent a mixture of sacred and profane objects, a selection of offerings, or as Prof. McDaniel suggested in his 1924 article about these disks, items loosely associated with the city of Tarentum. Favoring the latter explanation, McDaniel suggested that the symbols formed a \"compound seal\" used in commerce, associated with Tarentum. They would have been impressed in wax or on clay to form seal impressions that would be particularly difficult to duplicate due to their complexity.</td>\n",

       "      <td>These three prints are from Mark Tobey's Transitions portfolio of seven aquatints.  Tobey, one of the \"mystical painters of the Northwest,\" had become a member of the Bahai World Faith in 1918 and in 1934 visited China and Japan.  His noted \"white writing\" style of painting--an overlay of white calligraphic style symbols on an abstract field--evolved from his study of Asian calligraphy and brush painting during this visit.  Tobey spent much of his life working in the Seattle area but in 1960 moved to Basel, Switzerland.  The Transitions portfolio was published in Frankfurt in 1970 and the prints clearly grow out of his \"white writing\" style.  The titles of the prints, Trio, Devoted, and Movement in White convey the artist's life-long interest in spiritual themes.</td>\n",

Several are known, found in Italy, particularly in the south and around ancient Taras/Tarentum (Taranto). Some are in relief, but most have the symbols impressed into the disk.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe disks often bear many of the same motifs, some arranged in similar configurations from object to object. The objects may represent divinities--some common associations like Zeus with the thunderbolt, Hephaistos with the tongs, Poseidon with the trident, Hermes with the caduceus, Apollo with the lyre, and Athena with the owl are very clear--but many are in fact everyday items that are not necessrily associated with any particular god or goddess. They may, therefore, represent a mixture of sacred and profane objects, a selection of offerings, or as Prof. McDaniel suggested in his 1924 article about these disks, items loosely associated with the city of Tarentum. Favoring the latter explanation, McDaniel suggested that the symbols formed a \"compound seal\" used in commerce, associated with Tarentum. They would have been impressed in wax or on clay to form seal impressions that would be particularly difficult to duplicate due to their complexity.\n",

Tobey, one of the \"mystical painters of the Northwest,\" had become a member of the Bahai World Faith in 1918 and in 1934 visited China and Japan.  His noted \"white writing\" style of painting--an overlay of white calligraphic style symbols on an abstract field--evolved from his study of Asian calligraphy and brush painting during this visit.  Tobey spent much of his life working in the Seattle area but in 1960 moved to Basel, Switzerland.  The Transitions portfolio was published in Frankfurt in 1970 and the prints clearly grow out of his \"white writing\" style.  The titles of the prints, Trio, Devoted, and Movement in White convey the artist's life-long interest in spiritual themes.\n",

Examples of it can be seen in almost every portrait of Mughal emperors and courtiers from the late 16th century to the 19th century.

Several are known, found in Italy, particularly in the south and around ancient Taras/Tarentum (Taranto). Some are in relief, but most have the symbols impressed into the disk.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe disks often bear many of the same motifs, some arranged in similar configurations from object to object. The objects may represent divinities--some common associations like Zeus with the thunderbolt, Hephaistos with the tongs, Poseidon with the trident, Hermes with the caduceus, Apollo with the lyre, and Athena with the owl are very clear--but many are in fact everyday items that are not necessrily associated with any particular god or goddess. They may, therefore, represent a mixture of sacred and profane objects, a selection of offerings, or as Prof. McDaniel suggested in his 1924 article about these disks, items loosely associated with the city of Tarentum. Favoring the latter explanation, McDaniel suggested that the symbols formed a \"compound seal\" used in commerce, associated with Tarentum. They would have been impressed in wax or on clay to form seal impressions that would be particularly difficult to duplicate due to their complexity.</td>\n",

The album contained prints by Miro, Picasso, Tanguy, and others, with the addition of a poem by Paul Eluard.  Masson's etching L'Espagne assassinée vividly illustrates the idea of civil war, depicting a chicken (symbolizing Spain) attacking and blinding itself.  Masson also incorporated the symbol of the swastika (reversed in the printing process) as an appendage of the bird's leg to equate Franco with German fascism.  This print marks the first collaboration between Masson and the British printmaker Stanley William Hayter.  Hayter was deeply moved by the Spanish Civil War (as was Masson) and was responsible for organizing the Solidarité album and printing it at his experimental workshop Atelier 17 in Paris.  Hayter continued to work with Masson and became an important figure in his printing career.  Hayter later relocated Atelier 17 to New York and continued working with experimental printing techniques.  Masson made eighteen prints there between 1941 and 1945 while he was in exile.  The second print, Rodeo, is representative of this period.  Masson saw his first rodeo in 1945 and soon thereafter made this print.

The event advertised aligns Fluxus with the avant-garde performance group the San Francisco Mime Troupe (who, it should be noted, do not perform pantomime but instead consider themselves 'mimics', satirists of contemporary life and its absurdities) and San Francisco acid-rock band Quicksilver Messenger Service. While poster's hybrid visual style of psychedelia-influenced art nouveau would likely have been anathema to George Maciunas's rigorously monochromatic, absurdist functionalism, it testifies both to the flexibility of the \"Fluxus\" moniker and to the fact that during the 1960s a range of experimental practices coexisted within the larger formation of \"counterculture\".

He encountered European modernism during a 1909-13 trip to Europe and was especially taken with a show of Fururist paintings at the Bernheim-Jeune Gallery in Paris in 1912.  On his return in 1913, he experienced the further shock of the Armory Show, and for several years painted in a Futurist style, which gradually became more hieratic and stylized by the end of the decade with his famous works based on the Brooklyn Bridge, of which the Fogg owns three drawings.  For the remainder of his career Stella vacillated wildly between styles and never recaptured the intensity of the work he did in the teens.

Each print comprises a smattering of texts and images: some fragmentary, some fully realized, some drawn on the stone, some transferred from other sources. Prince's hand-written texts tell jokes, the kinds of raunchy, yet classic jokes allegedly told among men. The prints are an extension of his painting practice. In the late 1980s, Prince began a series of joke paintings that critics have related to the humor and cartoon imagery featured in men's magazines like Playboy. In fact, the portfolio box that contains the prints the prints is decorated with a Playboy bunny on its cover. Yet although Prince deploys such iconic signifiers of masculinity as the bunny and dirty traveling salesmen jokes, the picture of masculinity he conjures is a confusing questioning one. In fact even the Playboy bunny is manipulated-it's given a dangerous-looking set of teeth. Included among the texts are affirmations of male homosexuality, certainly a subject taboo in men's porn magazines. The print publisher Susan Inglett claims that the drawings for the prints were made after prince and his wife separated and he was engaged in a homosexual affair. Whatever his personal stake in the imagery is, the prints examine masculinity in a sensitive, smart, and unusual way.</td>\n",

The emperor Diocletian (284 - 305 CE) in 293 CE established the Tetrarchy: a new system dividing the administration of East and West, with two senior emperors, the Augusti, and two junior emperors, the Caesares.\\r\\n \\r\\nWhen this coin was minted, Constantius Chlorus was the Augustus in the western empire and Galerius (Gaius Galerius Valerius Maximianus) was Augustus in the eastern empire. Much official imperial iconography during the Tetrarchy sought to present the emperors as united, after a century of civil war. Coins issued by one co-emperor depicting his colleague helped project an image of unity and stability. The similarity of their portraits also contributed to this message: the emperors’ images are difficult to distinguish from each other, presenting a unified image of imperial rule.\\r\\n \\r\\nThis is one such coin. It depicts a portrait of Galerius, identifiable from his titles listed in the inscription. It, however, was minted in Italy, in the western part of the empire, and thus was issued under the authority of his co-Augustus, Constantius Chlorus.</td>\n",

The sheets were intended to be taken away from the gallery, that is, the paper sculpture show could occur in three dimensions in any space anywhere; but in the several exhibition venues where the sheets were available, the sculptures were made up and could be viewed as completed works of art.  We already have a portfolio issued in 1995 in a large edition by The Sculpture Center in New York, in which sculptors make two-dimensional distillations of their sculptural aesthetic. \"The Paper Sculpture Show\" takes the process much further, and is more akin to the 1968 SMS portfolios, also in our collection, where offset photolithographic \"things\" -- some of which requiring assembly -- are bundled together, to be unpacked by the owners of the portfolios wherever they please .

The print shows Tanning as a young art student carrying her portfolio of drawings, which when opened proves to hold her psychic self, her self-projection as an erotic fantasy, naked from the waist down (whatever part of her body that does not show with the portfolio closed). She rides a red-feathered cyclopean humanoid of indeterminate sex which, in turn, rides a white avian creature on a perch; the red creature is wringing the neck of the white creature.  Although Tanning shows herself at a very young age -- perhaps still an adolescent -- the monstrous birds suggest she is significantly older.  \\r\\n\\r\\nShe moved to New York City in 1935 and in the 1940s met the surrealist painter Max Ernst, whom she would marry in 1946.

Sandri himself suffered from mental illness: the lithograph is dated to the year preceding his first entrance into an insane asylum. He would be repeatedly hospitalized until his death, in the hospital, in 1937.  Sandri's intense image of the author, whose suffering from physical ills and unconsummated loves was the basis for his tragic poetry, must derive some of its affecting introspective mood from the artist's own troubled mind. \\r\\n\\r\\nSandri's work has received critical attention in Italy, most recently in exhibitions in Milan (2001,S. Ambrogio Museum, \"From sufferance to faith\") and Rome (2002, Palazzo delle Esposizioni, \"Art, madness, a language of the soul\"). It seems as if the emphasis was placed on his drawn portraits of fellow patients, as well as his landscapes, which seem to be greatly appreciated by critics.  In 1965, the critic L. Bracchi, on the occasion of a posthumous exhibition in Saronno, wrote, \"I recall above all his graphic work which is impressive. From a psychological point of view I especially recall the splendid drawings of the lunatics. They are real portraits carried out with a dedication worthy of Dürer. They are precise even if simple pencil drawings. We must not forget his paintings that show his love of nature which he shows simply as if through the eyes of an innocent child, which our friend Sandri was.\" These sentiments are typical of later criticism as well. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis portrait of the dead Leopardi, apparently imagined at night under a grape arbor, embodies the same synthesis of portrait draftsmanship and a sensibility toward nature. Beyond the artistic quality of the image, this is a remarkably sensitive blend of lithographic crayon and tusche, printed with exquisite delicacy on a toned sheet of laid paper.  The grain of the paper shows through the expanses of black wash, harmonizing them with the luminous features of the poet, which are realized in crayon.</td>\n",

It is one of three planet subjects, the others being Mars and Mercury, all with the same approximate composition.  This is, however, the most engaging, with its view of S. Gimignano in the midst of an intramural war.  The towers of the medieval city were supposed to have been constructed as acts of rivalry among its wealthy resident families, but the idea of siege engines, flaming barrages from catapults, and executed traitors seems to have been Disertori's fantasy.  Were hostilities provoked by rape, adultery, and other acts of illicit love, sparked by the planetary goddess above? \\r\\n\\r\\nThe inscription in a somewhat garbled Latin claims, however, that Venus will bring peace:  \"[as translated into Italian in the catalogue raisonne] Salve o Venere cacciatrice di bellezza, rinata in cielo dalla stella soave per portare pace nella bella città.\"  Drawings survive that show that Disertori derived the siege engines and other instruments of war from several medieval visual sources, including the Paris 1483 edition of Valturio's \"De re militari\" and manuscripts in Italian archives.  The archaism is characteristic: Disertori was also a great student of early music, and his personal collection of books, manuscripts, scores, and instruments is still preserved, in Il Fondo \"Benvenuto Disertori\" of the Biblioteca Nazionale Braidense, in Milan.</td>\n",

Corona was created during a period of transition when the artist began to combine her stain technique with areas of dense impasto.

In addition to providing a valuable didactic comparison to our Pollack as well as late 50's works by East Coast artists (Kelly, Stella, etc.), Golden Spur will hopefully form the nucleus for further collection of West Coast painters of the 50s and 60s.</td>\n",

It was the alternate, so to speak, to a portfolio of ten prints by ten different artists; all of these were produced by Gemini (GEL).  The portfolio also included this image by Serra, but in much reduced dimensions and with the inscription and much of the smudgy background eliminated.  This large image must reproduce far more faithfully the original drawing by the artist. Serra's work is resolutely abstract; that the political imperative of the moment moved him to figuration makes this poster especially interesting. One wonders whether its impact will remain so strong after the photograph of a tortured Iraqi prisoner on which it was based has faded from our collective memory. There is, of course, a long history of printed images of war-time atrocities, and those by Goya, for instance, remain as searing as ever.</td>\n",

       "      <td>This portfolio of thirty graphic designs by the Austrian artist Koloman Moser was created as a pattern book for surface coverings of all kinds. Published in Vienna in 1902, it was the third in of a series of commercial graphics portfolios produced under the name \"The Source\" (Die Quelle) and took its place among the many other model and pattern books that had become popular around the turn of the century. Each lithograph in the portfolio is printed in one of four pairs of colors and inset with a decorative cartouche bearing the design's title and intended use in carefully coordinated script. In some cases Moser also incorporated a complementary emblem or motif. Moser's creations range from his whimsical bathroom wall decoration \"Waves of the Danube\" (no. 4), composed of rows of interlocking mermaids, to more severely abstract designs for carpets, printed fabrics, and endpapers, illustrating the Viennese taste for repeated geometric forms and flat decorative pattern. Together the designs exemplify the turn-of-the-century belief that art should enter every aspect of life, which became a guiding principle for the Wiener Werkstätte (Vienna Workshops), the design collaborative that Moser co-founded in 1903 with Josef Hoffmann and Fritz Wärndorfer.</td>\n",

He became a professor in Hangzhou and showed his paintings in Shanghai in 1946. He also organized the first exhibition of modern Chinese painters at the National Historical Museum of Tchoung-King before fleeing political unrest for Paris, where he worked briefly with Emile Othon-Friesz and attracted the admiration of major painters.  Escaping the early influence of Matisse and Picasso, Zao adopted a style of his own, mixing Chinese signs with the poetic lines of Paul Klee.  From 1955, Zao gave up figurative painting for lyrical abstraction with a Chinese sense of space and gesture. Rouge Bleu Noir is a classic example of this moment in his work.  He represented France at the 40th International Exhibition of the Carnegie Institute of Pittsburgh in 1956 and made a trip around the world with Pierre Soulages in 1957-58. After choosing to become a French citizen in 1964, Zao had his first retrospective exhibition in Essen the following year. His second retrospective was at the Museum of Contemporary Art of Montreal and the Museum of Quebec in 1969. He continues to work today and is much revered in China.</td>\n",

Although the Chalcographie published proof impressions prior to lettering the plate for the regular edition, this impression does not bear the Chalcographie seal. It is evidently one of the dozen or so preliminary proofs pulled by Delâtre, which according to Michel Melot, cataloguer of Daubigny's prints, were much more desirable than the Chalcographie proofs. Even earlier proofs, complete with the artist's signature, as here, were also pulled, some prior to extensive cross-hatching. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis impression is in perfect condition, which derives from an important French 19th-century collection, that of Alfred Lebrun, a banker and serious print amateur, who was the first cataloguer of the printed oeuvre of Millet.

The patka was a long, narrow, textile associated with courtly dress. The patka was worn about the wearer's waist, over top a long shirt.\n",

Several are known, found in Italy, particularly in the south and around ancient Taras/Tarentum (Taranto). Some are in relief, but most have the symbols impressed into the disk.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe disks often bear many of the same motifs, some arranged in similar configurations from object to object. The objects may represent divinities--some common associations like Zeus with the thunderbolt, Hephaistos with the tongs, Poseidon with the trident, Hermes with the caduceus, Apollo with the lyre, and Athena with the owl are very clear--but many are in fact everyday items that are not necessrily associated with any particular god or goddess. They may, therefore, represent a mixture of sacred and profane objects, a selection of offerings, or as Prof. McDaniel suggested in his 1924 article about these disks, items loosely associated with the city of Tarentum. Favoring the latter explanation, McDaniel suggested that the symbols formed a \"compound seal\" used in commerce, associated with Tarentum. They would have been impressed in wax or on clay to form seal impressions that would be particularly difficult to duplicate due to their complexity.\n",

In 1938 Masson was invited to contribute a print to the album Solidarité that was published to raise money for Spanish orphans during the Civil War.  The album contained prints by Miro, Picasso, Tanguy, and others, with the addition of a poem by Paul Eluard.  Masson's etching L'Espagne assassinée vividly illustrates the idea of civil war, depicting a chicken (symbolizing Spain) attacking and blinding itself.  Masson also incorporated the symbol of the swastika (reversed in the printing process) as an appendage of the bird's leg to equate Franco with German fascism.  This print marks the first collaboration between Masson and the British printmaker Stanley William Hayter.  Hayter was deeply moved by the Spanish Civil War (as was Masson) and was responsible for organizing the Solidarité album and printing it at his experimental workshop Atelier 17 in Paris.  Hayter continued to work with Masson and became an important figure in his printing career.  Hayter later relocated Atelier 17 to New York and continued working with experimental printing techniques.  Masson made eighteen prints there between 1941 and 1945 while he was in exile.  The second print, Rodeo, is representative of this period.  Masson saw his first rodeo in 1945 and soon thereafter made this print.  The subject matter shows a clear relationship to the bullfight, which Masson had previously depicted during his stay in Spain.  He later used a similar composition depicting a slain bull in the album Toro (1951).\n",

The event advertised aligns Fluxus with the avant-garde performance group the San Francisco Mime Troupe (who, it should be noted, do not perform pantomime but instead consider themselves 'mimics', satirists of contemporary life and its absurdities) and San Francisco acid-rock band Quicksilver Messenger Service. While poster's hybrid visual style of psychedelia-influenced art nouveau would likely have been anathema to George Maciunas's rigorously monochromatic, absurdist functionalism, it testifies both to the flexibility of the \"Fluxus\" moniker and to the fact that during the 1960s a range of experimental practices coexisted within the larger formation of \"counterculture\". The graphics are the work of Ida Griffin, wife of the famous psychedelic artist Rick Griffin. The poster was printed at Berkeley-Bonaparte, the distribution agency Griffin founded in 1967 with Alton Kelley, Stanley Mouse, Victor Moscoso and Wes Wilson, all important psychedelic artists.\n",

The free development of the individual in society was one of Grave's concerns. A quote from the French-Swiss writer Madame de Staël's (Anne-Louise-Germaine Necker, Baroness de Staël-Holstein, 1766-1817) novel \"Delphine\" (1802) extends from recto to verso. For Napoleon this novel about the limits of women's freedom in an aristocratic society was controversial enough to exile the writer. \\r\\n\\r\\nSome of the inscriptions on the verso probably refer to the scene on the other side of the page (2 recto). At the bottom of the page Cross has written the title of the French edition of \"Sartor Resartus: The Life and Opinions of Herr Teufelsdrocke\" (1831) by the English writer Thomas Carlyle (1795-1881).\n",

The paper-pulp print depicts Stevie Wonder as pictured on his 1977 compilation album, \"Looking Back.\" The musician looks very 1970s chic--wearing dark aviator glasses, a short, tight afro, and a wide-collared nylon shirt. Light sparkles from the corner of his glasses. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe print was made at the papermaking studio, Dieu Donné. It is composed of a series of pulp-paper circles that are grouped together like giant Ben-Day dots. To make the image, Ligon made a drawing based on the album cover that was then printed on mylar. Stencils were cut from the mylar sheets and paper pulp was pushed through the cut-out circles onto a light blue sheet of paper. The raised circles of black and white paper pulp give the image a three-dimensional presence.\n",

Diebenkorn began sporadically making prints in the early 60s, often turning to printmaking during breaks from painting, and became the first artist published by Crown Point Press.  Beginning with his 1977 portfolio of nine prints and continuing in this 1978 portfolio one sees Diebenkorn's movement away from representation to an interest in more formal, abstract compositions in his prints.  They are experimental in nature (Diebenkorn often reworked the plates by scraping, burnishing, and adding drypoint lines), and show an exploration of planar and linear relationships, textural variety of linear marks, and contrasts of tonal values.  Numbered in the order in which they were made, each print in this group can be viewed singularly.  However, they become even more powerful when studied as a series, as a relationship from one composition to the next becomes evident.\n",

Cross had affinity with these ideas. With others in the Neo-Impressionist circle like Signac, Pissarro, and Luce he supported the anarchism of Jean Grave (1854-1939) by providing illustrations for Grave's \"Les Temps nouveaux,\" which spread the ideas of Pierre Kropotkin (1842-1921). They dreamt of a so-called Golden Age that would become reality after the destruction of the bourgeois society. Cross visualised this golden age in paintings of sunbathed, harmonious gatherings at the waterside. \\r\\n\\r\\nInterestingly enough, Cross's friend the painter Paul Signac called the Brussels house that he moved into in 1897 the \"joyous house\" and the \"city of the future.\" Signac and Cross spent much time together in 1897, so Cross's note might be directly related to his friend's remark.\n",

The painting ranks as one of the more successful attempts to capture speed and movement in paint, perhaps in part because of its quick execution.  The blurred features of the dog and the vigorous scrubbing of the landscape combine to create an impression of tremendous vitality.\\r\\n        \\r\\nBorn near Naples in 1877, Stella emigrated to New York City in 1896, where he studied with William Merritt Chase and may have been influenced by Robert Henri as well, witness his preference for contemporary urban subjects.  He encountered European modernism during a 1909-13 trip to Europe and was especially taken with a show of Fururist paintings at the Bernheim-Jeune Gallery in Paris in 1912.  On his return in 1913, he experienced the further shock of the Armory Show, and for several years painted in a Futurist style, which gradually became more hieratic and stylized by the end of the decade with his famous works based on the Brooklyn Bridge, of which the Fogg owns three drawings.  For the remainder of his career Stella vacillated wildly between styles and never recaptured the intensity of the work he did in the teens.  Dating his works is difficult, so the \"circa 1914\" is an educated guess open to revision pending further research.  \\r\\n\n",

Each print comprises a smattering of texts and images: some fragmentary, some fully realized, some drawn on the stone, some transferred from other sources. Prince's hand-written texts tell jokes, the kinds of raunchy, yet classic jokes allegedly told among men. The prints are an extension of his painting practice. In the late 1980s, Prince began a series of joke paintings that critics have related to the humor and cartoon imagery featured in men's magazines like Playboy. In fact, the portfolio box that contains the prints the prints is decorated with a Playboy bunny on its cover. Yet although Prince deploys such iconic signifiers of masculinity as the bunny and dirty traveling salesmen jokes, the picture of masculinity he conjures is a confusing questioning one. In fact even the Playboy bunny is manipulated-it's given a dangerous-looking set of teeth. Included among the texts are affirmations of male homosexuality, certainly a subject taboo in men's porn magazines. The print publisher Susan Inglett claims that the drawings for the prints were made after prince and his wife separated and he was engaged in a homosexual affair. Whatever his personal stake in the imagery is, the prints examine masculinity in a sensitive, smart, and unusual way.\n",

Although not very well known today, he was called one of the most celebrated artists of his day. Much of his work consists of portraits. His portrait etchings were recognized for the intensity of their psychological insights and considered \"cruel\" in their truth of depiction. John frequently used his artistic acquaintences as models, this is a portrait of his his sister, the artist Gwen John.\n",

Although not very well known today, he was called one of the most celebrated artists of his day. Much of his work consists of portraits. His portrait etchings were recognized for the intensity of their psychological insights and considered \"cruel\" in their truth of depiction. This self-portrait signals John's familiarity with Rembrandt's etched self-portraits. In the portrait (Dodgson 5), the artist wears a hat similar to Rembrandt's and sits in a like posture, while also holding an etching plate and stylus.\n",

They usually look fastidiously hand crafted, as do the forms apparent in this softground etching by the artist. The shape of \"Shoulders\" suggests a yoke or the frame of a bed, but because the form exists against an undefined background, it is impossible to identify the object depicted. Like Puryear's sculpture, it reminds the viewer of something else but doesn't offer the satisfaction of identification, thereby throwing into question the viewer's relationship to the depicted object.\n",

The emperor Diocletian (284 - 305 CE) in 293 CE established the Tetrarchy: a new system dividing the administration of East and West, with two senior emperors, the Augusti, and two junior emperors, the Caesares.\\r\\n \\r\\nWhen this coin was minted, Constantius Chlorus was the Augustus in the western empire and Galerius (Gaius Galerius Valerius Maximianus) was Augustus in the eastern empire. Much official imperial iconography during the Tetrarchy sought to present the emperors as united, after a century of civil war. Coins issued by one co-emperor depicting his colleague helped project an image of unity and stability. The similarity of their portraits also contributed to this message: the emperors’ images are difficult to distinguish from each other, presenting a unified image of imperial rule.\\r\\n \\r\\nThis is one such coin. It depicts a portrait of Galerius, identifiable from his titles listed in the inscription. It, however, was minted in Italy, in the western part of the empire, and thus was issued under the authority of his co-Augustus, Constantius Chlorus.\n",

The tradition of using rosewater came to Mughal India from Iran, where, in the festival of Ab Pashan, rosewater was sprinkled to invoke the memory of rainfall, which would put an end to famine. The custom was gradually incorporated into the Rajput court, where it was used in both ceremonial as well as religious festivals.

In fact, Desboutin and the woman in the painting, another friend of Degas, were simply models for the artist, not disreputable habitués. Just as Degas often painted and drew, and occasionally etched, portraits of his friends, so also did Desboutin, making two drypoints of Degas.  (The other is a full-length sketch.)  He also rendered their mutual friend Nina de Callas in drypoint.\n",

Note that there is a horizontal break indicated in the drawing that suggests that the columns are higher than they appear. The shorter proportions are almost identical to the columns at Leighton House.

What the Paper Sculpture Show consists of is seventy-seven sheets of paper, by thirty artists (including two persons working together as a single \"artist\"), who have each created  a sculpture that is to be cut out from one to four sheets of paper and assembled by a gallery visitor.  The sheets were intended to be taken away from the gallery, that is, the paper sculpture show could occur in three dimensions in any space anywhere; but in the several exhibition venues where the sheets were available, the sculptures were made up and could be viewed as completed works of art.  We already have a portfolio issued in 1995 in a large edition by The Sculpture Center in New York, in which sculptors make two-dimensional distillations of their sculptural aesthetic. \"The Paper Sculpture Show\" takes the process much further, and is more akin to the 1968 SMS portfolios, also in our collection, where offset photolithographic \"things\" -- some of which requiring assembly -- are bundled together, to be unpacked by the owners of the portfolios wherever they please .  Fluxus boxes, while not usually requiring any assembly on the part of their owner, also require participation, even performance.  SMS and Fluxus are essentially movements of the late 1960s; the Paper Sculpture show is their grandchild.\n",

The print shows Tanning as a young art student carrying her portfolio of drawings, which when opened proves to hold her psychic self, her self-projection as an erotic fantasy, naked from the waist down (whatever part of her body that does not show with the portfolio closed). She rides a red-feathered cyclopean humanoid of indeterminate sex which, in turn, rides a white avian creature on a perch; the red creature is wringing the neck of the white creature.  Although Tanning shows herself at a very young age -- perhaps still an adolescent -- the monstrous birds suggest she is significantly older.  \\r\\n\\r\\nShe moved to New York City in 1935 and in the 1940s met the surrealist painter Max Ernst, whom she would marry in 1946.  Ernst characteristically personified his iconic motifs as savant bird forms, and thus this young girl riding high over two surrealist (in her own style) birds, in a tableau filled with sex and violence, must evoke her existence after the war, when she and Ernst lived in France for the most part.\n",

Presumably this is an image incorporated in, or related to, Sandri's illustrations to \"Fanciulli d'Italia\" by A.V. Gentile, published in 1921. Two toughs, their cruel faces in profile, stand menacingly in front of two less hardened men, one young, one old, seen full-face.  The artist's brilliant combination of pose and attitude, together with the vigorous patterning of the blocked-in black shirts and sketchy rendering of the rest of the forms, creates a singularly sophisticated image, which rises above caricature.  This is a parallel to the far more famous tusche lithographs of Nolde and especially Grosz, which document parallel developments among the Germans to the north.\n",
       "24934  Sandri has imagined the spiritual portrait of Italy's greatest Romantic poet, Giacomo Leopardi (1798-1837), basing his image on lifetime painted portraits of the sickly, melancholic Leopardi.  Sandri himself suffered from mental illness: the lithograph is dated to the year preceding his first entrance into an insane asylum. He would be repeatedly hospitalized until his death, in the hospital, in 1937.  Sandri's intense image of the author, whose suffering from physical ills and unconsummated loves was the basis for his tragic poetry, must derive some of its affecting introspective mood from the artist's own troubled mind. \\r\\n\\r\\nSandri's work has received critical attention in Italy, most recently in exhibitions in Milan (2001,S. Ambrogio Museum, \"From sufferance to faith\") and Rome (2002, Palazzo delle Esposizioni, \"Art, madness, a language of the soul\"). It seems as if the emphasis was placed on his drawn portraits of fellow patients, as well as his landscapes, which seem to be greatly appreciated by critics.  In 1965, the critic L. Bracchi, on the occasion of a posthumous exhibition in Saronno, wrote, \"I recall above all his graphic work which is impressive. From a psychological point of view I especially recall the splendid drawings of the lunatics. They are real portraits carried out with a dedication worthy of Dürer. They are precise even if simple pencil drawings. We must not forget his paintings that show his love of nature which he shows simply as if through the eyes of an innocent child, which our friend Sandri was.\" These sentiments are typical of later criticism as well. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis portrait of the dead Leopardi, apparently imagined at night under a grape arbor, embodies the same synthesis of portrait draftsmanship and a sensibility toward nature. Beyond the artistic quality of the image, this is a remarkably sensitive blend of lithographic crayon and tusche, printed with exquisite delicacy on a toned sheet of laid paper.  The grain of the paper shows through the expanses of black wash, harmonizing them with the luminous features of the poet, which are realized in crayon.\n",

It is one of three planet subjects, the others being Mars and Mercury, all with the same approximate composition.  This is, however, the most engaging, with its view of S. Gimignano in the midst of an intramural war.  The towers of the medieval city were supposed to have been constructed as acts of rivalry among its wealthy resident families, but the idea of siege engines, flaming barrages from catapults, and executed traitors seems to have been Disertori's fantasy.  Were hostilities provoked by rape, adultery, and other acts of illicit love, sparked by the planetary goddess above? \\r\\n\\r\\nThe inscription in a somewhat garbled Latin claims, however, that Venus will bring peace:  \"[as translated into Italian in the catalogue raisonne] Salve o Venere cacciatrice di bellezza, rinata in cielo dalla stella soave per portare pace nella bella città.\"  Drawings survive that show that Disertori derived the siege engines and other instruments of war from several medieval visual sources, including the Paris 1483 edition of Valturio's \"De re militari\" and manuscripts in Italian archives.  The archaism is characteristic: Disertori was also a great student of early music, and his personal collection of books, manuscripts, scores, and instruments is still preserved, in Il Fondo \"Benvenuto Disertori\" of the Biblioteca Nazionale Braidense, in Milan.\n",

Her \"soak-stain\" painting technique had a significant impact on artists of 1950s and 1960s, particularly on Kenneth Noland and Morris Louis, who are both represented in the Fogg's collection. Corona was created during a period of transition when the artist began to combine her stain technique with areas of dense impasto. This work, along with Rex, is the first painting by the artist to enter the collection.\n",

Teaching at the California School of Fine Arts in the late 40s, he came to know Clyfford Still, David Park, and Richard Deibenkorn. Golden Spur, which is strongly influenced by Pollack's late manner, comes after Smith found his own style of abstraction, which is lively, witty, and decorative, but before he turned to figuration. In addition to providing a valuable didactic comparison to our Pollack as well as late 50's works by East Coast artists (Kelly, Stella, etc.), Golden Spur will hopefully form the nucleus for further collection of West Coast painters of the 50s and 60s.\n",

It was the alternate, so to speak, to a portfolio of ten prints by ten different artists; all of these were produced by Gemini (GEL).  The portfolio also included this image by Serra, but in much reduced dimensions and with the inscription and much of the smudgy background eliminated.  This large image must reproduce far more faithfully the original drawing by the artist. Serra's work is resolutely abstract; that the political imperative of the moment moved him to figuration makes this poster especially interesting. One wonders whether its impact will remain so strong after the photograph of a tortured Iraqi prisoner on which it was based has faded from our collective memory. There is, of course, a long history of printed images of war-time atrocities, and those by Goya, for instance, remain as searing as ever.\n",

Published in Vienna in 1902, it was the third in of a series of commercial graphics portfolios produced under the name \"The Source\" (Die Quelle) and took its place among the many other model and pattern books that had become popular around the turn of the century. Each lithograph in the portfolio is printed in one of four pairs of colors and inset with a decorative cartouche bearing the design's title and intended use in carefully coordinated script. In some cases Moser also incorporated a complementary emblem or motif. Moser's creations range from his whimsical bathroom wall decoration \"Waves of the Danube\" (no. 4), composed of rows of interlocking mermaids, to more severely abstract designs for carpets, printed fabrics, and endpapers, illustrating the Viennese taste for repeated geometric forms and flat decorative pattern. Together the designs exemplify the turn-of-the-century belief that art should enter every aspect of life, which became a guiding principle for the Wiener Werkstätte (Vienna Workshops), the design collaborative that Moser co-founded in 1903 with Josef Hoffmann and Fritz Wärndorfer.\n",

He became a professor in Hangzhou and showed his paintings in Shanghai in 1946. He also organized the first exhibition of modern Chinese painters at the National Historical Museum of Tchoung-King before fleeing political unrest for Paris, where he worked briefly with Emile Othon-Friesz and attracted the admiration of major painters.  Escaping the early influence of Matisse and Picasso, Zao adopted a style of his own, mixing Chinese signs with the poetic lines of Paul Klee.  From 1955, Zao gave up figurative painting for lyrical abstraction with a Chinese sense of space and gesture. Rouge Bleu Noir is a classic example of this moment in his work.  He represented France at the 40th International Exhibition of the Carnegie Institute of Pittsburgh in 1956 and made a trip around the world with Pierre Soulages in 1957-58. After choosing to become a French citizen in 1964, Zao had his first retrospective exhibition in Essen the following year. His second retrospective was at the Museum of Contemporary Art of Montreal and the Museum of Quebec in 1969. He continues to work today and is much revered in China.\n",

B. Yeats, Jack Yeats is known as Ireland's great modern painter, both because he had few peers among his countrymen and because his work affectionately documents his native land.  Starting out as an illustrator, he was soon exposed to post-impressionsim, symbolism, and more recent developments (such as the Armory Show of 1913, in which he was included).  Nonetheless, he stayed aloof from international currents and developed an expressive style remarkable for its personal, painterly touch.  This work represents Yeats at his finest and most daring.\n",

Although the Chalcographie published proof impressions prior to lettering the plate for the regular edition, this impression does not bear the Chalcographie seal. It is evidently one of the dozen or so preliminary proofs pulled by Delâtre, which according to Michel Melot, cataloguer of Daubigny's prints, were much more desirable than the Chalcographie proofs. Even earlier proofs, complete with the artist's signature, as here, were also pulled, some prior to extensive cross-hatching. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis impression is in perfect condition, which derives from an important French 19th-century collection, that of Alfred Lebrun, a banker and serious print amateur, who was the first cataloguer of the printed oeuvre of Millet. Lebrun would have had the inclination and would have been in a position to acquire the earliest proofs of a plate such as this.\n",

Several are known, found in Italy, particularly in the south and around ancient Taras/Tarentum (Taranto). Some are in relief, but most have the symbols impressed into the disk.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe disks often bear many of the same motifs, some arranged in similar configurations from object to object. The objects may represent divinities--some common associations like Zeus with the thunderbolt, Hephaistos with the tongs, Poseidon with the trident, Hermes with the caduceus, Apollo with the lyre, and Athena with the owl are very clear--but many are in fact everyday items that are not necessrily associated with any particular god or goddess. They may, therefore, represent a mixture of sacred and profane objects, a selection of offerings, or as Prof. McDaniel suggested in his 1924 article about these disks, items loosely associated with the city of Tarentum.

While poster's hybrid visual style of psychedelia-influenced art nouveau would likely have been anathema to George Maciunas's rigorously monochromatic, absurdist functionalism, it testifies both to the flexibility of the \"Fluxus\" moniker and to the fact that during the 1960s a range of experimental practices coexisted within the larger formation of \"counterculture\".

He encountered European modernism during a 1909-13 trip to Europe and was especially taken with a show of Fururist paintings at the Bernheim-Jeune Gallery in Paris in 1912.  On his return in 1913, he experienced the further shock of the Armory Show, and for several years painted in a Futurist style, which gradually became more hieratic and stylized by the end of the decade with his famous works based on the Brooklyn Bridge, of which the Fogg owns three drawings.  For the remainder of his career Stella vacillated wildly between styles and never recaptured the intensity of the work he did in the teens.

Each print comprises a smattering of texts and images: some fragmentary, some fully realized, some drawn on the stone, some transferred from other sources. Prince's hand-written texts tell jokes, the kinds of raunchy, yet classic jokes allegedly told among men. The prints are an extension of his painting practice. In the late 1980s, Prince began a series of joke paintings that critics have related to the humor and cartoon imagery featured in men's magazines like Playboy. In fact, the portfolio box that contains the prints the prints is decorated with a Playboy bunny on its cover. Yet although Prince deploys such iconic signifiers of masculinity as the bunny and dirty traveling salesmen jokes, the picture of masculinity he conjures is a confusing questioning one. In fact even the Playboy bunny is manipulated-it's given a dangerous-looking set of teeth. Included among the texts are affirmations of male homosexuality, certainly a subject taboo in men's porn magazines. The print publisher Susan Inglett claims that the drawings for the prints were made after prince and his wife separated and he was engaged in a homosexual affair. Whatever his personal stake in the imagery is, the prints examine masculinity in a sensitive, smart, and unusual way.</td>\n",

The emperor Diocletian (284 - 305 CE) in 293 CE established the Tetrarchy: a new system dividing the administration of East and West, with two senior emperors, the Augusti, and two junior emperors, the Caesares.\\r\\n \\r\\nWhen this coin was minted, Constantius Chlorus was the Augustus in the western empire and Galerius (Gaius Galerius Valerius Maximianus) was Augustus in the eastern empire. Much official imperial iconography during the Tetrarchy sought to present the emperors as united, after a century of civil war. Coins issued by one co-emperor depicting his colleague helped project an image of unity and stability. The similarity of their portraits also contributed to this message: the emperors’ images are difficult to distinguish from each other, presenting a unified image of imperial rule.\\r\\n \\r\\nThis is one such coin. It depicts a portrait of Galerius, identifiable from his titles listed in the inscription. It, however, was minted in Italy, in the western part of the empire, and thus was issued under the authority of his co-Augustus, Constantius Chlorus.</td>\n",

What the Paper Sculpture Show consists of is seventy-seven sheets of paper, by thirty artists (including two persons working together as a single \"artist\"), who have each created  a sculpture that is to be cut out from one to four sheets of paper and assembled by a gallery visitor.  The sheets were intended to be taken away from the gallery, that is, the paper sculpture show could occur in three dimensions in any space anywhere; but in the several exhibition venues where the sheets were available, the sculptures were made up and could be viewed as completed works of art.  We already have a portfolio issued in 1995 in a large edition by The Sculpture Center in New York, in which sculptors make two-dimensional distillations of their sculptural aesthetic. \"The Paper Sculpture Show\" takes the process much further, and is more akin to the 1968 SMS portfolios, also in our collection, where offset photolithographic \"things\" -- some of which requiring assembly -- are bundled together, to be unpacked by the owners of the portfolios wherever they please .  Fluxus boxes, while not usually requiring any assembly on the part of their owner, also require participation, even performance.  SMS and Fluxus are essentially movements of the late 1960s; the Paper Sculpture show is their grandchild.</td>\n",

The print shows Tanning as a young art student carrying her portfolio of drawings, which when opened proves to hold her psychic self, her self-projection as an erotic fantasy, naked from the waist down (whatever part of her body that does not show with the portfolio closed). She rides a red-feathered cyclopean humanoid of indeterminate sex which, in turn, rides a white avian creature on a perch; the red creature is wringing the neck of the white creature.  Although Tanning shows herself at a very young age -- perhaps still an adolescent -- the monstrous birds suggest she is significantly older.  \\r\\n\\r\\nShe moved to New York City in 1935 and in the 1940s met the surrealist painter Max Ernst, whom she would marry in 1946.  Ernst characteristically personified his iconic motifs as savant bird forms, and thus this young girl riding high over two surrealist (in her own style) birds, in a tableau filled with sex and violence, must evoke her existence after the war, when she and Ernst lived in France for the most part.</td>\n",

Gentile, published in 1921. Two toughs, their cruel faces in profile, stand menacingly in front of two less hardened men, one young, one old, seen full-face.  The artist's brilliant combination of pose and attitude, together with the vigorous patterning of the blocked-in black shirts and sketchy rendering of the rest of the forms, creates a singularly sophisticated image, which rises above caricature.

       "      <td>Sandri has imagined the spiritual portrait of Italy's greatest Romantic poet, Giacomo Leopardi (1798-1837), basing his image on lifetime painted portraits of the sickly, melancholic Leopardi.  Sandri himself suffered from mental illness: the lithograph is dated to the year preceding his first entrance into an insane asylum. He would be repeatedly hospitalized until his death, in the hospital, in 1937.  Sandri's intense image of the author, whose suffering from physical ills and unconsummated loves was the basis for his tragic poetry, must derive some of its affecting introspective mood from the artist's own troubled mind. \\r\\n\\r\\nSandri's work has received critical attention in Italy, most recently in exhibitions in Milan (2001,S. Ambrogio Museum, \"From sufferance to faith\") and Rome (2002, Palazzo delle Esposizioni, \"Art, madness, a language of the soul\"). It seems as if the emphasis was placed on his drawn portraits of fellow patients, as well as his landscapes, which seem to be greatly appreciated by critics.  In 1965, the critic L. Bracchi, on the occasion of a posthumous exhibition in Saronno, wrote, \"I recall above all his graphic work which is impressive. From a psychological point of view I especially recall the splendid drawings of the lunatics. They are real portraits carried out with a dedication worthy of Dürer. They are precise even if simple pencil drawings. We must not forget his paintings that show his love of nature which he shows simply as if through the eyes of an innocent child, which our friend Sandri was.\" These sentiments are typical of later criticism as well. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis portrait of the dead Leopardi, apparently imagined at night under a grape arbor, embodies the same synthesis of portrait draftsmanship and a sensibility toward nature. Beyond the artistic quality of the image, this is a remarkably sensitive blend of lithographic crayon and tusche, printed with exquisite delicacy on a toned sheet of laid paper.  The grain of the paper shows through the expanses of black wash, harmonizing them with the luminous features of the poet, which are realized in crayon.</td>\n",

Gimignano in the midst of an intramural war.  The towers of the medieval city were supposed to have been constructed as acts of rivalry among its wealthy resident families, but the idea of siege engines, flaming barrages from catapults, and executed traitors seems to have been Disertori's fantasy.  Were hostilities provoked by rape, adultery, and other acts of illicit love, sparked by the planetary goddess above? \\r\\n\\r\\nThe inscription in a somewhat garbled Latin claims, however, that Venus will bring peace:  \"[as translated into Italian in the catalogue raisonne] Salve o Venere cacciatrice di bellezza, rinata in cielo dalla stella soave per portare pace nella bella città.\"  Drawings survive that show that Disertori derived the siege engines and other instruments of war from several medieval visual sources, including the Paris 1483 edition of Valturio's \"De re militari\" and manuscripts in Italian archives.

Published in Vienna in 1902, it was the third in of a series of commercial graphics portfolios produced under the name \"The Source\" (Die Quelle) and took its place among the many other model and pattern books that had become popular around the turn of the century. Each lithograph in the portfolio is printed in one of four pairs of colors and inset with a decorative cartouche bearing the design's title and intended use in carefully coordinated script. In some cases Moser also incorporated a complementary emblem or motif. Moser's creations range from his whimsical bathroom wall decoration \"Waves of the Danube\" (no. 4), composed of rows of interlocking mermaids, to more severely abstract designs for carpets, printed fabrics, and endpapers, illustrating the Viennese taste for repeated geometric forms and flat decorative pattern. Together the designs exemplify the turn-of-the-century belief that art should enter every aspect of life, which became a guiding principle for the Wiener Werkstätte (Vienna Workshops), the design collaborative that Moser co-founded in 1903 with Josef Hoffmann and Fritz Wärndorfer.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Zao Wou Ki was bon in 1921 in Beijing and attended the School of Fine Arts of Hangzhou, dividing his studies between Western art and traditional Chinese art. He became a professor in Hangzhou and showed his paintings in Shanghai in 1946. He also organized the first exhibition of modern Chinese painters at the National Historical Museum of Tchoung-King before fleeing political unrest for Paris, where he worked briefly with Emile Othon-Friesz and attracted the admiration of major painters.  Escaping the early influence of Matisse and Picasso, Zao adopted a style of his own, mixing Chinese signs with the poetic lines of Paul Klee.  From 1955, Zao gave up figurative painting for lyrical abstraction with a Chinese sense of space and gesture. Rouge Bleu Noir is a classic example of this moment in his work.  He represented France at the 40th International Exhibition of the Carnegie Institute of Pittsburgh in 1956 and made a trip around the world with Pierre Soulages in 1957-58. After choosing to become a French citizen in 1964, Zao had his first retrospective exhibition in Essen the following year. His second retrospective was at the Museum of Contemporary Art of Montreal and the Museum of Quebec in 1969. He continues to work today and is much revered in China.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The brother of the poet W. B. Yeats, Jack Yeats is known as Ireland's great modern painter, both because he had few peers among his countrymen and because his work affectionately documents his native land.  Starting out as an illustrator, he was soon exposed to post-impressionsim, symbolism, and more recent developments (such as the Armory Show of 1913, in which he was included).  Nonetheless, he stayed aloof from international currents and developed an expressive style remarkable for its personal, painterly touch.  This work represents Yeats at his finest and most daring.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Daubigny, among all the French etchers of the 19th century, was uniquely qualified to execute prints after the Dutch painter, Ruisdael, since he had modeled many aspects of his own landscape painting style after the earlier master and, in 1853, he had been awarded a 1st class medal at the French Salon for etching, a requirement for commissions from the Chalcographie of the Bibliotheque Nationale. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis plate, commissioned in 1855 from the Ruisdael painting \"Le Coup de Soleil\", in the collection of the Louvre since the late 18th century, was completed in 1860 and exhibited at the 1861 Salon. Although the Chalcographie published proof impressions prior to lettering the plate for the regular edition, this impression does not bear the Chalcographie seal. It is evidently one of the dozen or so preliminary proofs pulled by Delâtre, which according to Michel Melot, cataloguer of Daubigny's prints, were much more desirable than the Chalcographie proofs. Even earlier proofs, complete with the artist's signature, as here, were also pulled, some prior to extensive cross-hatching. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis impression is in perfect condition, which derives from an important French 19th-century collection, that of Alfred Lebrun, a banker and serious print amateur, who was the first cataloguer of the printed oeuvre of Millet. Lebrun would have had the inclination and would have been in a position to acquire the earliest proofs of a plate such as this.</td>\n",

Examples of it can be seen in almost every portrait of Mughal emperors and courtiers from the late 16th century to the 19th century. The patka was a long, narrow, textile associated with courtly dress. The patka was worn about the wearer's waist, over top a long shirt.   \n",

Several are known, found in Italy, particularly in the south and around ancient Taras/Tarentum (Taranto). Some are in relief, but most have the symbols impressed into the disk.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe disks often bear many of the same motifs, some arranged in similar configurations from object to object. The objects may represent divinities--some common associations like Zeus with the thunderbolt, Hephaistos with the tongs, Poseidon with the trident, Hermes with the caduceus, Apollo with the lyre, and Athena with the owl are very clear--but many are in fact everyday items that are not necessrily associated with any particular god or goddess. They may, therefore, represent a mixture of sacred and profane objects, a selection of offerings, or as Prof. McDaniel suggested in his 1924 article about these disks, items loosely associated with the city of Tarentum. Favoring the latter explanation, McDaniel suggested that the symbols formed a \"compound seal\" used in commerce, associated with Tarentum. They would have been impressed in wax or on clay to form seal impressions that would be particularly difficult to duplicate due to their complexity.   \n",

In 1938 Masson was invited to contribute a print to the album Solidarité that was published to raise money for Spanish orphans during the Civil War.  The album contained prints by Miro, Picasso, Tanguy, and others, with the addition of a poem by Paul Eluard.  Masson's etching L'Espagne assassinée vividly illustrates the idea of civil war, depicting a chicken (symbolizing Spain) attacking and blinding itself.  Masson also incorporated the symbol of the swastika (reversed in the printing process) as an appendage of the bird's leg to equate Franco with German fascism.  This print marks the first collaboration between Masson and the British printmaker Stanley William Hayter.  Hayter was deeply moved by the Spanish Civil War (as was Masson) and was responsible for organizing the Solidarité album and printing it at his experimental workshop Atelier 17 in Paris.  Hayter continued to work with Masson and became an important figure in his printing career.  Hayter later relocated Atelier 17 to New York and continued working with experimental printing techniques.  Masson made eighteen prints there between 1941 and 1945 while he was in exile.  The second print, Rodeo, is representative of this period.  Masson saw his first rodeo in 1945 and soon thereafter made this print.  The subject matter shows a clear relationship to the bullfight, which Masson had previously depicted during his stay in Spain.  He later used a similar composition depicting a slain bull in the album Toro (1951).   \n",

The event advertised aligns Fluxus with the avant-garde performance group the San Francisco Mime Troupe (who, it should be noted, do not perform pantomime but instead consider themselves 'mimics', satirists of contemporary life and its absurdities) and San Francisco acid-rock band Quicksilver Messenger Service. While poster's hybrid visual style of psychedelia-influenced art nouveau would likely have been anathema to George Maciunas's rigorously monochromatic, absurdist functionalism, it testifies both to the flexibility of the \"Fluxus\" moniker and to the fact that during the 1960s a range of experimental practices coexisted within the larger formation of \"counterculture\". The graphics are the work of Ida Griffin, wife of the famous psychedelic artist Rick Griffin. The poster was printed at Berkeley-Bonaparte, the distribution agency Griffin founded in 1967 with Alton Kelley, Stanley Mouse, Victor Moscoso and Wes Wilson, all important psychedelic artists.   \n",

The free development of the individual in society was one of Grave's concerns. A quote from the French-Swiss writer Madame de Staël's (Anne-Louise-Germaine Necker, Baroness de Staël-Holstein, 1766-1817) novel \"Delphine\" (1802) extends from recto to verso. For Napoleon this novel about the limits of women's freedom in an aristocratic society was controversial enough to exile the writer. \\r\\n\\r\\nSome of the inscriptions on the verso probably refer to the scene on the other side of the page (2 recto). At the bottom of the page Cross has written the title of the French edition of \"Sartor Resartus: The Life and Opinions of Herr Teufelsdrocke\" (1831) by the English writer Thomas Carlyle (1795-1881).   \n",

The paper-pulp print depicts Stevie Wonder as pictured on his 1977 compilation album, \"Looking Back.\" The musician looks very 1970s chic--wearing dark aviator glasses, a short, tight afro, and a wide-collared nylon shirt. Light sparkles from the corner of his glasses. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe print was made at the papermaking studio, Dieu Donné. It is composed of a series of pulp-paper circles that are grouped together like giant Ben-Day dots. To make the image, Ligon made a drawing based on the album cover that was then printed on mylar. Stencils were cut from the mylar sheets and paper pulp was pushed through the cut-out circles onto a light blue sheet of paper. The raised circles of black and white paper pulp give the image a three-dimensional presence.   \n",

Diebenkorn began sporadically making prints in the early 60s, often turning to printmaking during breaks from painting, and became the first artist published by Crown Point Press.  Beginning with his 1977 portfolio of nine prints and continuing in this 1978 portfolio one sees Diebenkorn's movement away from representation to an interest in more formal, abstract compositions in his prints.  They are experimental in nature (Diebenkorn often reworked the plates by scraping, burnishing, and adding drypoint lines), and show an exploration of planar and linear relationships, textural variety of linear marks, and contrasts of tonal values.  Numbered in the order in which they were made, each print in this group can be viewed singularly.  However, they become even more powerful when studied as a series, as a relationship from one composition to the next becomes evident.   \n",

Cross had affinity with these ideas. With others in the Neo-Impressionist circle like Signac, Pissarro, and Luce he supported the anarchism of Jean Grave (1854-1939) by providing illustrations for Grave's \"Les Temps nouveaux,\" which spread the ideas of Pierre Kropotkin (1842-1921). They dreamt of a so-called Golden Age that would become reality after the destruction of the bourgeois society. Cross visualised this golden age in paintings of sunbathed, harmonious gatherings at the waterside. \\r\\n\\r\\nInterestingly enough, Cross's friend the painter Paul Signac called the Brussels house that he moved into in 1897 the \"joyous house\" and the \"city of the future.\" Signac and Cross spent much time together in 1897, so Cross's note might be directly related to his friend's remark.   \n",

The painting ranks as one of the more successful attempts to capture speed and movement in paint, perhaps in part because of its quick execution.  The blurred features of the dog and the vigorous scrubbing of the landscape combine to create an impression of tremendous vitality.\\r\\n        \\r\\nBorn near Naples in 1877, Stella emigrated to New York City in 1896, where he studied with William Merritt Chase and may have been influenced by Robert Henri as well, witness his preference for contemporary urban subjects.  He encountered European modernism during a 1909-13 trip to Europe and was especially taken with a show of Fururist paintings at the Bernheim-Jeune Gallery in Paris in 1912.  On his return in 1913, he experienced the further shock of the Armory Show, and for several years painted in a Futurist style, which gradually became more hieratic and stylized by the end of the decade with his famous works based on the Brooklyn Bridge, of which the Fogg owns three drawings.  For the remainder of his career Stella vacillated wildly between styles and never recaptured the intensity of the work he did in the teens.  Dating his works is difficult, so the \"circa 1914\" is an educated guess open to revision pending further research.  \\r\\n   \n",

Each print comprises a smattering of texts and images: some fragmentary, some fully realized, some drawn on the stone, some transferred from other sources. Prince's hand-written texts tell jokes, the kinds of raunchy, yet classic jokes allegedly told among men. The prints are an extension of his painting practice. In the late 1980s, Prince began a series of joke paintings that critics have related to the humor and cartoon imagery featured in men's magazines like Playboy. In fact, the portfolio box that contains the prints the prints is decorated with a Playboy bunny on its cover. Yet although Prince deploys such iconic signifiers of masculinity as the bunny and dirty traveling salesmen jokes, the picture of masculinity he conjures is a confusing questioning one. In fact even the Playboy bunny is manipulated-it's given a dangerous-looking set of teeth. Included among the texts are affirmations of male homosexuality, certainly a subject taboo in men's porn magazines. The print publisher Susan Inglett claims that the drawings for the prints were made after prince and his wife separated and he was engaged in a homosexual affair. Whatever his personal stake in the imagery is, the prints examine masculinity in a sensitive, smart, and unusual way.   \n",

Although not very well known today, he was called one of the most celebrated artists of his day. Much of his work consists of portraits. His portrait etchings were recognized for the intensity of their psychological insights and considered \"cruel\" in their truth of depiction. John frequently used his artistic acquaintences as models, this is a portrait of his his sister, the artist Gwen John.   \n",

Although not very well known today, he was called one of the most celebrated artists of his day. Much of his work consists of portraits. His portrait etchings were recognized for the intensity of their psychological insights and considered \"cruel\" in their truth of depiction. This self-portrait signals John's familiarity with Rembrandt's etched self-portraits. In the portrait (Dodgson 5), the artist wears a hat similar to Rembrandt's and sits in a like posture, while also holding an etching plate and stylus.   \n",

This work presents a rather complete and perhaps unintentionally comic record of the reception of Continental modernist trends in England, not just with the inclusion of the Modigliani sculpture but also the Matisse-like tablecloth and the nods to Manet's early Spanish-inspired paintings (the guitar and shawl).  In addition, the book is reputed to represent Les Chants de Maldoror, a favorite of the artist and the virtual bible of Surrealism.   \n",

They usually look fastidiously hand crafted, as do the forms apparent in this softground etching by the artist. The shape of \"Shoulders\" suggests a yoke or the frame of a bed, but because the form exists against an undefined background, it is impossible to identify the object depicted. Like Puryear's sculpture, it reminds the viewer of something else but doesn't offer the satisfaction of identification, thereby throwing into question the viewer's relationship to the depicted object.   \n",

The emperor Diocletian (284 - 305 CE) in 293 CE established the Tetrarchy: a new system dividing the administration of East and West, with two senior emperors, the Augusti, and two junior emperors, the Caesares.\\r\\n \\r\\nWhen this coin was minted, Constantius Chlorus was the Augustus in the western empire and Galerius (Gaius Galerius Valerius Maximianus) was Augustus in the eastern empire. Much official imperial iconography during the Tetrarchy sought to present the emperors as united, after a century of civil war. Coins issued by one co-emperor depicting his colleague helped project an image of unity and stability. The similarity of their portraits also contributed to this message: the emperors’ images are difficult to distinguish from each other, presenting a unified image of imperial rule.\\r\\n \\r\\nThis is one such coin. It depicts a portrait of Galerius, identifiable from his titles listed in the inscription. It, however, was minted in Italy, in the western part of the empire, and thus was issued under the authority of his co-Augustus, Constantius Chlorus.   \n",

The tradition of using rosewater came to Mughal India from Iran, where, in the festival of Ab Pashan, rosewater was sprinkled to invoke the memory of rainfall, which would put an end to famine. The custom was gradually incorporated into the Rajput court, where it was used in both ceremonial as well as religious festivals.

In fact, Desboutin and the woman in the painting, another friend of Degas, were simply models for the artist, not disreputable habitués. Just as Degas often painted and drew, and occasionally etched, portraits of his friends, so also did Desboutin, making two drypoints of Degas.  (The other is a full-length sketch.)  He also rendered their mutual friend Nina de Callas in drypoint.   \n",

Note that there is a horizontal break indicated in the drawing that suggests that the columns are higher than they appear. The shorter proportions are almost identical to the columns at Leighton House.

What the Paper Sculpture Show consists of is seventy-seven sheets of paper, by thirty artists (including two persons working together as a single \"artist\"), who have each created  a sculpture that is to be cut out from one to four sheets of paper and assembled by a gallery visitor.  The sheets were intended to be taken away from the gallery, that is, the paper sculpture show could occur in three dimensions in any space anywhere; but in the several exhibition venues where the sheets were available, the sculptures were made up and could be viewed as completed works of art.  We already have a portfolio issued in 1995 in a large edition by The Sculpture Center in New York, in which sculptors make two-dimensional distillations of their sculptural aesthetic. \"The Paper Sculpture Show\" takes the process much further, and is more akin to the 1968 SMS portfolios, also in our collection, where offset photolithographic \"things\" -- some of which requiring assembly -- are bundled together, to be unpacked by the owners of the portfolios wherever they please .  Fluxus boxes, while not usually requiring any assembly on the part of their owner, also require participation, even performance.  SMS and Fluxus are essentially movements of the late 1960s; the Paper Sculpture show is their grandchild.   \n",

This sketch is related to a wooden shield covered with fish skin and decorated with ears of corn and crosses in the Bargello Museum.

The print shows Tanning as a young art student carrying her portfolio of drawings, which when opened proves to hold her psychic self, her self-projection as an erotic fantasy, naked from the waist down (whatever part of her body that does not show with the portfolio closed). She rides a red-feathered cyclopean humanoid of indeterminate sex which, in turn, rides a white avian creature on a perch; the red creature is wringing the neck of the white creature.  Although Tanning shows herself at a very young age -- perhaps still an adolescent -- the monstrous birds suggest she is significantly older.  \\r\\n\\r\\nShe moved to New York City in 1935 and in the 1940s met the surrealist painter Max Ernst, whom she would marry in 1946.  Ernst characteristically personified his iconic motifs as savant bird forms, and thus this young girl riding high over two surrealist (in her own style) birds, in a tableau filled with sex and violence, must evoke her existence after the war, when she and Ernst lived in France for the most part.   \n",

Presumably this is an image incorporated in, or related to, Sandri's illustrations to \"Fanciulli d'Italia\" by A.V. Gentile, published in 1921. Two toughs, their cruel faces in profile, stand menacingly in front of two less hardened men, one young, one old, seen full-face.  The artist's brilliant combination of pose and attitude, together with the vigorous patterning of the blocked-in black shirts and sketchy rendering of the rest of the forms, creates a singularly sophisticated image, which rises above caricature.  This is a parallel to the far more famous tusche lithographs of Nolde and especially Grosz, which document parallel developments among the Germans to the north.   \n",
       "24934  Sandri has imagined the spiritual portrait of Italy's greatest Romantic poet, Giacomo Leopardi (1798-1837), basing his image on lifetime painted portraits of the sickly, melancholic Leopardi.  Sandri himself suffered from mental illness: the lithograph is dated to the year preceding his first entrance into an insane asylum. He would be repeatedly hospitalized until his death, in the hospital, in 1937.  Sandri's intense image of the author, whose suffering from physical ills and unconsummated loves was the basis for his tragic poetry, must derive some of its affecting introspective mood from the artist's own troubled mind. \\r\\n\\r\\nSandri's work has received critical attention in Italy, most recently in exhibitions in Milan (2001,S. Ambrogio Museum, \"From sufferance to faith\") and Rome (2002, Palazzo delle Esposizioni, \"Art, madness, a language of the soul\"). It seems as if the emphasis was placed on his drawn portraits of fellow patients, as well as his landscapes, which seem to be greatly appreciated by critics.  In 1965, the critic L. Bracchi, on the occasion of a posthumous exhibition in Saronno, wrote, \"I recall above all his graphic work which is impressive. From a psychological point of view I especially recall the splendid drawings of the lunatics. They are real portraits carried out with a dedication worthy of Dürer. They are precise even if simple pencil drawings. We must not forget his paintings that show his love of nature which he shows simply as if through the eyes of an innocent child, which our friend Sandri was.\" These sentiments are typical of later criticism as well. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis portrait of the dead Leopardi, apparently imagined at night under a grape arbor, embodies the same synthesis of portrait draftsmanship and a sensibility toward nature. Beyond the artistic quality of the image, this is a remarkably sensitive blend of lithographic crayon and tusche, printed with exquisite delicacy on a toned sheet of laid paper.  The grain of the paper shows through the expanses of black wash, harmonizing them with the luminous features of the poet, which are realized in crayon.   \n",

It is one of three planet subjects, the others being Mars and Mercury, all with the same approximate composition.  This is, however, the most engaging, with its view of S. Gimignano in the midst of an intramural war.  The towers of the medieval city were supposed to have been constructed as acts of rivalry among its wealthy resident families, but the idea of siege engines, flaming barrages from catapults, and executed traitors seems to have been Disertori's fantasy.  Were hostilities provoked by rape, adultery, and other acts of illicit love, sparked by the planetary goddess above? \\r\\n\\r\\nThe inscription in a somewhat garbled Latin claims, however, that Venus will bring peace:  \"[as translated into Italian in the catalogue raisonne] Salve o Venere cacciatrice di bellezza, rinata in cielo dalla stella soave per portare pace nella bella città.\"  Drawings survive that show that Disertori derived the siege engines and other instruments of war from several medieval visual sources, including the Paris 1483 edition of Valturio's \"De re militari\" and manuscripts in Italian archives.  The archaism is characteristic: Disertori was also a great student of early music, and his personal collection of books, manuscripts, scores, and instruments is still preserved, in Il Fondo \"Benvenuto Disertori\" of the Biblioteca Nazionale Braidense, in Milan.   \n",

Her \"soak-stain\" painting technique had a significant impact on artists of 1950s and 1960s, particularly on Kenneth Noland and Morris Louis, who are both represented in the Fogg's collection. Corona was created during a period of transition when the artist began to combine her stain technique with areas of dense impasto. This work, along with Rex, is the first painting by the artist to enter the collection.   \n",

He made a series of dense, abstract black paintngs: one of the earliest was \"Small Black Painting\".  At the time he had recently become aware of the work of Clifford Still, Richard Diebenkorn, David Park, and other California artists.  For a decade, Neuman worked in a powerful, individual manner, in a style that puts him in the mainstream of this era.   \n",

Teaching at the California School of Fine Arts in the late 40s, he came to know Clyfford Still, David Park, and Richard Deibenkorn. Golden Spur, which is strongly influenced by Pollack's late manner, comes after Smith found his own style of abstraction, which is lively, witty, and decorative, but before he turned to figuration. In addition to providing a valuable didactic comparison to our Pollack as well as late 50's works by East Coast artists (Kelly, Stella, etc.), Golden Spur will hopefully form the nucleus for further collection of West Coast painters of the 50s and 60s.   \n",

It was the alternate, so to speak, to a portfolio of ten prints by ten different artists; all of these were produced by Gemini (GEL).  The portfolio also included this image by Serra, but in much reduced dimensions and with the inscription and much of the smudgy background eliminated.  This large image must reproduce far more faithfully the original drawing by the artist. Serra's work is resolutely abstract; that the political imperative of the moment moved him to figuration makes this poster especially interesting. One wonders whether its impact will remain so strong after the photograph of a tortured Iraqi prisoner on which it was based has faded from our collective memory. There is, of course, a long history of printed images of war-time atrocities, and those by Goya, for instance, remain as searing as ever.   \n",

Published in Vienna in 1902, it was the third in of a series of commercial graphics portfolios produced under the name \"The Source\" (Die Quelle) and took its place among the many other model and pattern books that had become popular around the turn of the century. Each lithograph in the portfolio is printed in one of four pairs of colors and inset with a decorative cartouche bearing the design's title and intended use in carefully coordinated script. In some cases Moser also incorporated a complementary emblem or motif. Moser's creations range from his whimsical bathroom wall decoration \"Waves of the Danube\" (no. 4), composed of rows of interlocking mermaids, to more severely abstract designs for carpets, printed fabrics, and endpapers, illustrating the Viennese taste for repeated geometric forms and flat decorative pattern. Together the designs exemplify the turn-of-the-century belief that art should enter every aspect of life, which became a guiding principle for the Wiener Werkstätte (Vienna Workshops), the design collaborative that Moser co-founded in 1903 with Josef Hoffmann and Fritz Wärndorfer.   \n",

He became a professor in Hangzhou and showed his paintings in Shanghai in 1946. He also organized the first exhibition of modern Chinese painters at the National Historical Museum of Tchoung-King before fleeing political unrest for Paris, where he worked briefly with Emile Othon-Friesz and attracted the admiration of major painters.  Escaping the early influence of Matisse and Picasso, Zao adopted a style of his own, mixing Chinese signs with the poetic lines of Paul Klee.  From 1955, Zao gave up figurative painting for lyrical abstraction with a Chinese sense of space and gesture. Rouge Bleu Noir is a classic example of this moment in his work.  He represented France at the 40th International Exhibition of the Carnegie Institute of Pittsburgh in 1956 and made a trip around the world with Pierre Soulages in 1957-58. After choosing to become a French citizen in 1964, Zao had his first retrospective exhibition in Essen the following year. His second retrospective was at the Museum of Contemporary Art of Montreal and the Museum of Quebec in 1969. He continues to work today and is much revered in China.   \n",

B. Yeats, Jack Yeats is known as Ireland's great modern painter, both because he had few peers among his countrymen and because his work affectionately documents his native land.  Starting out as an illustrator, he was soon exposed to post-impressionsim, symbolism, and more recent developments (such as the Armory Show of 1913, in which he was included).  Nonetheless, he stayed aloof from international currents and developed an expressive style remarkable for its personal, painterly touch.  This work represents Yeats at his finest and most daring.   \n",

Although the Chalcographie published proof impressions prior to lettering the plate for the regular edition, this impression does not bear the Chalcographie seal. It is evidently one of the dozen or so preliminary proofs pulled by Delâtre, which according to Michel Melot, cataloguer of Daubigny's prints, were much more desirable than the Chalcographie proofs. Even earlier proofs, complete with the artist's signature, as here, were also pulled, some prior to extensive cross-hatching. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis impression is in perfect condition, which derives from an important French 19th-century collection, that of Alfred Lebrun, a banker and serious print amateur, who was the first cataloguer of the printed oeuvre of Millet. Lebrun would have had the inclination and would have been in a position to acquire the earliest proofs of a plate such as this.   \n",

The molded handle and decorative appliques would have been made independently and pressed onto the body of the vessel.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. J.W.

In the late 1980s, Prince began a series of joke paintings that critics have related to the humor and cartoon imagery featured in men's magazines like Playboy. In fact, the portfolio box that contains the prints the prints is decorated with a Playboy bunny on its cover. Yet although Prince deploys such iconic signifiers of masculinity as the bunny and dirty traveling salesmen jokes, the picture of masculinity he conjures is a confusing questioning one. In fact even the Playboy bunny is manipulated-it's given a dangerous-looking set of teeth. Included among the texts are affirmations of male homosexuality, certainly a subject taboo in men's porn magazines. The print publisher Susan Inglett claims that the drawings for the prints were made after prince and his wife separated and he was engaged in a homosexual affair.

       "      <td>This lithograph is very much a latter-day Tanning, and she herself admits it is a retrospective self-portrait, according to the dealer from which this was purchased.  The print shows Tanning as a young art student carrying her portfolio of drawings, which when opened proves to hold her psychic self, her self-projection as an erotic fantasy, naked from the waist down (whatever part of her body that does not show with the portfolio closed). She rides a red-feathered cyclopean humanoid of indeterminate sex which, in turn, rides a white avian creature on a perch; the red creature is wringing the neck of the white creature.  Although Tanning shows herself at a very young age -- perhaps still an adolescent -- the monstrous birds suggest she is significantly older.  \\r\\n\\r\\nShe moved to New York City in 1935 and in the 1940s met the surrealist painter Max Ernst, whom she would marry in 1946.  Ernst characteristically personified his iconic motifs as savant bird forms, and thus this young girl riding high over two surrealist (in her own style) birds, in a tableau filled with sex and violence, must evoke her existence after the war, when she and Ernst lived in France for the most part.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Sandri has imagined the spiritual portrait of Italy's greatest Romantic poet, Giacomo Leopardi (1798-1837), basing his image on lifetime painted portraits of the sickly, melancholic Leopardi.  Sandri himself suffered from mental illness: the lithograph is dated to the year preceding his first entrance into an insane asylum. He would be repeatedly hospitalized until his death, in the hospital, in 1937.  Sandri's intense image of the author, whose suffering from physical ills and unconsummated loves was the basis for his tragic poetry, must derive some of its affecting introspective mood from the artist's own troubled mind. \\r\\n\\r\\nSandri's work has received critical attention in Italy, most recently in exhibitions in Milan (2001,S. Ambrogio Museum, \"From sufferance to faith\") and Rome (2002, Palazzo delle Esposizioni, \"Art, madness, a language of the soul\"). It seems as if the emphasis was placed on his drawn portraits of fellow patients, as well as his landscapes, which seem to be greatly appreciated by critics.  In 1965, the critic L. Bracchi, on the occasion of a posthumous exhibition in Saronno, wrote, \"I recall above all his graphic work which is impressive. From a psychological point of view I especially recall the splendid drawings of the lunatics. They are real portraits carried out with a dedication worthy of Dürer. They are precise even if simple pencil drawings. We must not forget his paintings that show his love of nature which he shows simply as if through the eyes of an innocent child, which our friend Sandri was.\" These sentiments are typical of later criticism as well. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis portrait of the dead Leopardi, apparently imagined at night under a grape arbor, embodies the same synthesis of portrait draftsmanship and a sensibility toward nature. Beyond the artistic quality of the image, this is a remarkably sensitive blend of lithographic crayon and tusche, printed with exquisite delicacy on a toned sheet of laid paper.  The grain of the paper shows through the expanses of black wash, harmonizing them with the luminous features of the poet, which are realized in crayon.</td>\n",

In fact, Desboutin and the woman in the painting, another friend of Degas, were simply models for the artist, not disreputable habitués. Just as Degas often painted and drew, and occasionally etched, portraits of his friends, so also did Desboutin, making two drypoints of Degas.  (The other is a full-length sketch.)

The print shows Tanning as a young art student carrying her portfolio of drawings, which when opened proves to hold her psychic self, her self-projection as an erotic fantasy, naked from the waist down (whatever part of her body that does not show with the portfolio closed). She rides a red-feathered cyclopean humanoid of indeterminate sex which, in turn, rides a white avian creature on a perch; the red creature is wringing the neck of the white creature.  Although Tanning shows herself at a very young age -- perhaps still an adolescent -- the monstrous birds suggest she is significantly older.  \\r\\n\\r\\nShe moved to New York City in 1935 and in the 1940s met the surrealist painter Max Ernst, whom she would marry in 1946.  Ernst characteristically personified his iconic motifs as savant bird forms, and thus this young girl riding high over two surrealist (in her own style) birds, in a tableau filled with sex and violence, must evoke her existence after the war, when she and Ernst lived in France for the most part.   \n",
       "24934  Sandri has imagined the spiritual portrait of Italy's greatest Romantic poet, Giacomo Leopardi (1798-1837), basing his image on lifetime painted portraits of the sickly, melancholic Leopardi.  Sandri himself suffered from mental illness: the lithograph is dated to the year preceding his first entrance into an insane asylum. He would be repeatedly hospitalized until his death, in the hospital, in 1937.  Sandri's intense image of the author, whose suffering from physical ills and unconsummated loves was the basis for his tragic poetry, must derive some of its affecting introspective mood from the artist's own troubled mind. \\r\\n\\r\\nSandri's work has received critical attention in Italy, most recently in exhibitions in Milan (2001,S. Ambrogio Museum, \"From sufferance to faith\") and Rome (2002, Palazzo delle Esposizioni, \"Art, madness, a language of the soul\"). It seems as if the emphasis was placed on his drawn portraits of fellow patients, as well as his landscapes, which seem to be greatly appreciated by critics.  In 1965, the critic L. Bracchi, on the occasion of a posthumous exhibition in Saronno, wrote, \"I recall above all his graphic work which is impressive. From a psychological point of view I especially recall the splendid drawings of the lunatics. They are real portraits carried out with a dedication worthy of Dürer. They are precise even if simple pencil drawings. We must not forget his paintings that show his love of nature which he shows simply as if through the eyes of an innocent child, which our friend Sandri was.\" These sentiments are typical of later criticism as well. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis portrait of the dead Leopardi, apparently imagined at night under a grape arbor, embodies the same synthesis of portrait draftsmanship and a sensibility toward nature. Beyond the artistic quality of the image, this is a remarkably sensitive blend of lithographic crayon and tusche, printed with exquisite delicacy on a toned sheet of laid paper.  The grain of the paper shows through the expanses of black wash, harmonizing them with the luminous features of the poet, which are realized in crayon.   \n",

In fact, Desboutin and the woman in the painting, another friend of Degas, were simply models for the artist, not disreputable habitués. Just as Degas often painted and drew, and occasionally etched, portraits of his friends, so also did Desboutin, making two drypoints of Degas.  (The other is a full-length sketch.)  He also rendered their mutual friend Nina de Callas in drypoint.   \n",
