       "      <td>In the mid-1970s, Jacob Lawrence, an established artist in his 50s, began making screenprints of subjects he had explored in painting throughout his career. His work depicts the African-American experience, as is apparent in this screenprint of migrant workers casting their votes in an election from the 1920s. Much of his work demonstrates his commitment to African Americans achieving racial equality, and he is best know for series on figures such as Frederick Douglas and Harriet Tubman. In 1940-41, Lawrence executed a series of 60 paintings entitled \"The Migration of the Negro,\" from which this print is thematically derived. After the first world war, millions of blacks left the south and moved to northern cities, where they experienced the freedom to vote for the first time. This screenprint is a complex layering of multiple colors and comes from the portfolio, the Kent Bicentennial Portfolio, commissioned by Lorillard, a division of Loews Theaters, Inc. Made in recognition of the American Bicentennial, artists contributing to the portfolio were asked to respond to the question, \" what does independence mean to you?\"</td>\n",

       "      <td>This oil flask belongs to a class of objects named by vase scholar J.D. Beazley (1885-1970) as the “Negro Alabastra Group” which all depict an image of a black warrior standing alone. The oil flask (alabastron) is typically considered to be a feminine object for feminine usage and is thought to have held scented perfumes or other similar kinds of substances. The shape and white-ground background are where it gets its name, the latter is believed to have been imitate the appearance of alabaster, out of which more expensive alabastra would have been made. \\r\\n\\r\\nScholars have debated on how to interpret the images of black warriors on such vessels: are they intended to represent a particular group of black warriors, like the warriors of Memnon from the Iliad? Are they a reference to black warriors fighting for the Persians as described by Herodotus? Though both of these hypotheses are possible, especially the latter considering the time period (early fifth century BCE.) in which they were made. However, it cannot be said for sure since the visual evidence of any specific contexts is lacking on the actual vessels.\\r\\n\\r\\n Another issue of interpretation is what these images have to do with the vessels on which they are painted. The warriors are often juxtaposed with images of a palm tree, as here, or of an Amazon, a female warrior generally connoted as foreign and non-Greek. One line of interpretation is that the images are intended to evoke a sense of exoticism, possibly referencing the far-off places from which the vessel’s contents - likely perfume - originated. Even if latter association is somewhat questionable, it is true that the images generally portray the “other.” Building on this reading is the fact that these vessels never depict the ideal Greek male citizen either as a hoplite (citizen warrior) or otherwise. Thus, as François Lissarrague argues, the feminine vessels coupled with the exotic imagery are intended to represent the realm of “the other,” which in Classical Greek society meant women and foreigners. \\r\\n\\r\\nSources\\r\\nBindman, David and Henry Louis Gates, ed., The Image of the Black in Western Art: From the Pharoahs to the Fall of the Roman Empire, The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press (Cambridge, 2010), pp. 158-159, fig. 164\\r\\n\\r\\nLissarrague, François.

       "      <td>Biggers was an African-American artist, who worked primarily as a mural painter and printmaker. He entered Hampton University in Virginia in 1941 where he studied with Viktor Lowenfeld, the former curator of the Museum of African art in Vienna. He was also acquainted with Charles White and Elizabeth Catlett, prominent black artists teaching at Hampton. While he was still an undergraduate, one of Biggers' paintings was included in a landmark exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in 1943, Young Negro Art, establishing his reputation. After completing his Ph.D. in fine arts at Pennsylvania State University, Biggers took a teaching position at Texas Southern University where he started the art department. Although he reached a level of national artistic distinction, he experienced the inequity of racial difference throughout his life. Awarded notable prizes by the Houston Museum of Fine Arts and the Dallas Museum of Art in the 1950s, he was unable to attend the all-white prize ceremonies at the museums.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis lithograph of two women working in a field is characteristic of his work of the late 1940s and early 1950s which focused on black folkways. Shielded from the sun in long dresses and wide-rimmed hats, the women carry a bucket and basket to haul their harvest. Their long arms hang from their tall, lean bodies, seemingly stretched from the work of bending and picking. Biggers' lithograph is composed of innumerable crayon strokes, both long and short, creating a range of shades of black and gray that give the image an overall dark and brooding tone.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Roni Horn's Confidence in Daybreak Modifies Dusk is part of her White Dickinson series.  In each of the White Dickinson's a phrase from one of Emily Dickinson's diaries or letters is pulled from its original context, cast in white plastic and embedded in an aluminum bar.  The bar is placed directly on the floor and propped against the wall.  This offhand presentation places it in the tradition of minimalist sculpture, which often relied on propping as a mode of sculptural presentation that allowed artists to forgo the problem of the base.  If Minimalist sculpture sought to strip away all emotional affect in the name of phenomenology then Horn's sculptural practice tends to reinsert affect, albeit through the putatively affect free conceptual art gesture of language.  Unlike the dry language of much conceptual art, Horn's longstanding use of Emily Dickinson clearly points to different concerns.  In essence, Horn has borrowed the formal rigor of minimalism combined it with the austerity of conceptual art and inflected it with a poetic sensibility, one that tends to hinge on various aspects of identity and structures of feeling (the very things negated by minimalism's recourse to phenomenology).  This work finds a special home at the Fogg since Harvard is the repository of all of Emily Dickinson's papers.  In this way the work also becomes emblematic of art that begins with the process of research in an archive.  Here Horn's appropriation of Dickinson's language serves, potentially, to activate the archive, to transform it from a potentially static collection of fetishised objects and transform it into an engine that helps to make other things.  So too this work joins Glenn Ligon's Untitled (Negro Sunshine) as a works that use language, particularly the language of much celebrated feminist or proto-feminist authors, in ways that extend conceptual's art's turn away from the visual, for they are, on the one hand, quite transparent through their use of such clear and concise language and on the other completely mysterious in their evocation of mental images and complex psychological states.\\r\\n\\r\\n--Helen Molesworth, 2008</td>\n",

Both objects were produced during the British campaign to abolish slavery. An active abolitionist movement persisted in Britain because owning enslaved people was not outlawed until 1833, with its final abolishment in 1838. Ceramics such as these would have been sold at abolitionist gatherings, providing ways to support the cause. The display of these wares on the table was intended to prompt a sympathetic visual response from those who used them. \\r\\n\\r\\nThese objects have smooth, clear ceramic bodies, with beautiful glazes and gilding, but their images evoke horror. The front of the jug shows a man in bondage, and the back of the jug features stanzas from William Cowper’s influential poem “The Negro’s Complaint” (1788), written from the perspective of an enslaved man. The emblem on the butter tub presents an enslaved woman set against a background with a palm tree. This tropical setting directly references the labor of enslaved people responsible for sugar production in the Caribbean. \\r\\n\\r\\n[2015.33, 2017.84]</td>\n",

His work depicts the African-American experience, as is apparent in this screenprint of migrant workers casting their votes in an election from the 1920s. Much of his work demonstrates his commitment to African Americans achieving racial equality, and he is best know for series on figures such as Frederick Douglas and Harriet Tubman. In 1940-41, Lawrence executed a series of 60 paintings entitled \"The Migration of the Negro,\" from which this print is thematically derived. After the first world war, millions of blacks left the south and moved to northern cities, where they experienced the freedom to vote for the first time. This screenprint is a complex layering of multiple colors and comes from the portfolio, the Kent Bicentennial Portfolio, commissioned by Lorillard, a division of Loews Theaters, Inc. Made in recognition of the American Bicentennial, artists contributing to the portfolio were asked to respond to the question, \" what does independence mean to you?\"   \n",

       "432  This oil flask belongs to a class of objects named by vase scholar J.D. Beazley (1885-1970) as the “Negro Alabastra Group” which all depict an image of a black warrior standing alone. The oil flask (alabastron) is typically considered to be a feminine object for feminine usage and is thought to have held scented perfumes or other similar kinds of substances. The shape and white-ground background are where it gets its name, the latter is believed to have been imitate the appearance of alabaster, out of which more expensive alabastra would have been made. \\r\\n\\r\\nScholars have debated on how to interpret the images of black warriors on such vessels: are they intended to represent a particular group of black warriors, like the warriors of Memnon from the Iliad? Are they a reference to black warriors fighting for the Persians as described by Herodotus? Though both of these hypotheses are possible, especially the latter considering the time period (early fifth century BCE.) in which they were made. However, it cannot be said for sure since the visual evidence of any specific contexts is lacking on the actual vessels.\\r\\n\\r\\n Another issue of interpretation is what these images have to do with the vessels on which they are painted. The warriors are often juxtaposed with images of a palm tree, as here, or of an Amazon, a female warrior generally connoted as foreign and non-Greek. One line of interpretation is that the images are intended to evoke a sense of exoticism, possibly referencing the far-off places from which the vessel’s contents - likely perfume - originated. Even if latter association is somewhat questionable, it is true that the images generally portray the “other.” Building on this reading is the fact that these vessels never depict the ideal Greek male citizen either as a hoplite (citizen warrior) or otherwise. Thus, as François Lissarrague argues, the feminine vessels coupled with the exotic imagery are intended to represent the realm of “the other,” which in Classical Greek society meant women and foreigners. \\r\\n\\r\\nSources\\r\\nBindman, David and Henry Louis Gates, ed., The Image of the Black in Western Art: From the Pharoahs to the Fall of the Roman Empire, The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press (Cambridge, 2010), pp. 158-159, fig. 164\\r\\n\\r\\nLissarrague, François.

He entered Hampton University in Virginia in 1941 where he studied with Viktor Lowenfeld, the former curator of the Museum of African art in Vienna. He was also acquainted with Charles White and Elizabeth Catlett, prominent black artists teaching at Hampton. While he was still an undergraduate, one of Biggers' paintings was included in a landmark exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in 1943, Young Negro Art, establishing his reputation. After completing his Ph.D. in fine arts at Pennsylvania State University, Biggers took a teaching position at Texas Southern University where he started the art department. Although he reached a level of national artistic distinction, he experienced the inequity of racial difference throughout his life. Awarded notable prizes by the Houston Museum of Fine Arts and the Dallas Museum of Art in the 1950s, he was unable to attend the all-white prize ceremonies at the museums.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis lithograph of two women working in a field is characteristic of his work of the late 1940s and early 1950s which focused on black folkways. Shielded from the sun in long dresses and wide-rimmed hats, the women carry a bucket and basket to haul their harvest. Their long arms hang from their tall, lean bodies, seemingly stretched from the work of bending and picking. Biggers' lithograph is composed of innumerable crayon strokes, both long and short, creating a range of shades of black and gray that give the image an overall dark and brooding tone.   \n",

He wears patterned trousers, reminiscent of foreign dress depicted in other vases, and a cuirass with shoulder flaps, tied by a black belt. His quiver is strapped to his waist. His head is turned to the left, curly hair rendered by simple black dots. To his right is a small table. On the side opposite him is a tall palm tree with a rippling trunk.   \n",

       "500  Roni Horn's Confidence in Daybreak Modifies Dusk is part of her White Dickinson series.  In each of the White Dickinson's a phrase from one of Emily Dickinson's diaries or letters is pulled from its original context, cast in white plastic and embedded in an aluminum bar.  The bar is placed directly on the floor and propped against the wall.  This offhand presentation places it in the tradition of minimalist sculpture, which often relied on propping as a mode of sculptural presentation that allowed artists to forgo the problem of the base.  If Minimalist sculpture sought to strip away all emotional affect in the name of phenomenology then Horn's sculptural practice tends to reinsert affect, albeit through the putatively affect free conceptual art gesture of language.  Unlike the dry language of much conceptual art, Horn's longstanding use of Emily Dickinson clearly points to different concerns.  In essence, Horn has borrowed the formal rigor of minimalism combined it with the austerity of conceptual art and inflected it with a poetic sensibility, one that tends to hinge on various aspects of identity and structures of feeling (the very things negated by minimalism's recourse to phenomenology).  This work finds a special home at the Fogg since Harvard is the repository of all of Emily Dickinson's papers.  In this way the work also becomes emblematic of art that begins with the process of research in an archive.  Here Horn's appropriation of Dickinson's language serves, potentially, to activate the archive, to transform it from a potentially static collection of fetishised objects and transform it into an engine that helps to make other things.  So too this work joins Glenn Ligon's Untitled (Negro Sunshine) as a works that use language, particularly the language of much celebrated feminist or proto-feminist authors, in ways that extend conceptual's art's turn away from the visual, for they are, on the one hand, quite transparent through their use of such clear and concise language and on the other completely mysterious in their evocation of mental images and complex psychological states.\\r\\n\\r\\n--Helen Molesworth, 2008   \n",

       "507  What can these two everyday objects tell us about the relationship between taste and global politics in the first decades of the 19th century? Both objects were produced during the British campaign to abolish slavery. An active abolitionist movement persisted in Britain because owning enslaved people was not outlawed until 1833, with its final abolishment in 1838. Ceramics such as these would have been sold at abolitionist gatherings, providing ways to support the cause. The display of these wares on the table was intended to prompt a sympathetic visual response from those who used them. \\r\\n\\r\\nThese objects have smooth, clear ceramic bodies, with beautiful glazes and gilding, but their images evoke horror. The front of the jug shows a man in bondage, and the back of the jug features stanzas from William Cowper’s influential poem “The Negro’s Complaint” (1788), written from the perspective of an enslaved man. The emblem on the butter tub presents an enslaved woman set against a background with a palm tree. This tropical setting directly references the labor of enslaved people responsible for sugar production in the Caribbean. \\r\\n\\r\\n[2015.33, 2017.84]    \n",

       "      <td>Best known today for her story quilts addressing feminism and racial justice, Ringgold’s work of the 1960s and ’70s was more polemical. In Red White Black Nigger, Ringgold confronts the highly charged and topical subject of the role of blackness within American culture. Inspired in part by Jasper Johns’s flag paintings, Ringgold references the colors of the U.S. flag both linguistically and visually. She uses black pigment to modulate the work’s dominant red, white, and blue pigments, rather than mixing them with white as painters traditionally had done. Most pointedly, Ringgold painted the word “NIGGER” within each horizontal swath of color. This abhorrent, incendiary word evokes centuries of oppression and the violent reaction to the struggle for civil rights and the black power movement in the late 1960s. Yet against the darkened background, the word nearly disappears, a possible allusion to the white cultural erasure of African Americans and the pervasive stain of racism within the national fabric. Ringgold’s substitution of the word “black” in the third row, where one might expect the word “blue,” stops the viewer short and insists on recognition of this country’s inability to deliver on its promise of liberty for all.</td>\n",

       "      <td>It is an open question whether the sea god depicted should be understood as Nereus, the “Old Man of the Sea”, or Triton, Poseidon’s messenger. In Athenian vase-painting, the iconography of these two figures regularly overlaps and it can be difficult to distinguish them. Broadly speaking, Triton is younger, and characterised by a more wild, animalistic nature by comparison with the old man Nereus who is more civilized, and is often even depicted in an entirely human form. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe most important story involving Nereus was an encounter with Herakles, who was supposed to have wrestled him in order to make him reveal the location of the garden of the Hesperides. This is the account given in literary versions of the myth, but depictions of the struggle in vase-painting often substitute Triton for Nereus. \\r\\n\\r\\nA number of early vases (c. 590-570 B.C.E.) depict Heracles struggling with a fish-tailed Nereus, but by 560 B.C.E. painters begin to depict the subject in two distinct ways, with Heracles fighting either an anthropomorphic Nereus, or, much more commonly, a fish-tailed god who must usually be understood as Triton, and is explicitly identified as such by inscriptions on a handful of slightly later vases (London B223, BAPD 320266; Berlin F1906, BAPD 306469; Cambridge G54, BAPD 12709). \\r\\n\\r\\nParticularly important is London B223 (BAPD 320266) which includes the figure of Nereus watching the fight between Triton and Herakles, with all the figures identified by inscriptions, confirming that the two sea-gods were conceived of as different deities (Paris F298, BAPD 302299 also includes Nereus as a spectator to the fight, identified by an inscription). Nonetheless, the iconography of both figures overlaps substantially, and it is often impossible to say for sure whether a given fish-tailed god is Nereus or Triton. The question of exactly why Triton supplanted Nereus as Herakles’ opponent is difficult to answer and has been attributed by different scholars to historical and political events, to art historical development, and to literary influence. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe figure on this vase has often been identified as Triton because of his half-man, half-fish nature, corresponding to the figure that is depicted fighting Herakles in vases of this period. However, comparison with other depictions of Nereus by the same painter suggest that he is probably better thought of as Nereus.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a particularly close resemblance to a figure who is undeniably Nereus on another vase by the Berlin Painter, the stamnos Munich 8738 (BAPD 201980). The stamnos also features a Nereid, with an almost identical pose to the Nereid on the Harvard vase, running towards him, supporting the notion that the Harvard vase depicts the same sea-god. One important difference, however, is that the Nereus on Munich vessel is depicted with lighter hair painted in dilute slip, suggestive of his old age, while the Harvard figure has his hair rendered in black and there are no obvious indications of his age.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother Berlin Painter vase, the hydria London E162 (BAPD 202006), depicts the fight between Herakles and Nereus, and although Nereus is in human form, he, like the figure on the Harvard vase, wears a long cloak and holds both a scepter and a dolphin. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe way that the figure’s cloak masks the transition from human to animal also resembles the Berlin Painter’s depictions of another ‘civilized’ hybrid creature, the centaur Chiron who, unlike the other wild and savage centaurs, was tutor to a number of heroes (Paris G186, BAPD 201959; Munich 8738, BAPD 201980), another point in favour of its identification with the relatively ‘civilized’ Nereus rather than Triton.\\r\\n\\r\\nSee further: \\r\\n\\r\\nJudith M.

       "      <td>On one side: a half-anthropomorphic, half-fish sea-god, Nereus, or perhaps Triton. He faces to the right and carries a scepter in his right hand with his little finger extended, and a dolphin in his left, which he holds by the tail. He has long curly hair tied into a bun and a beard. He wears a wreath in added red on his head, and a cloak (himation) decorated with triple dot motifs over a long-sleeved tunic (chiton). Instead of legs, he has a huge fish tail, which rises out of the bottom of his cloak (which conceals the junction between man and fish) and curves around before it ends in a stylised crescent-shaped tail fin, more like a dolphin’s tail than a fish’s. The tail is slightly tinted with dilute glaze and is decorated with single dots in a grid-like arrangement, with a reserved stripe marked out along its length. There are two pairs of fins coming out of the tail.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other side: presumably a Nereid. The Nereids were the sea-nymph daughters of Nereus, the most famous of whom is Thetis, the mother of Achilles. She walks to the left with a wide step, her arms extended in front of her. Her right hand is higher up and seems to point toward the left. She wears a long-sleeved tunic (chiton). This woman is not specifically identified by an inscription or by any iconographical detail, but we can be reasonably sure from the context – alongside the sea god – that she is a Nereid. \\r\\n\\r\\nStrips of meander pattern act as ground line for the two figures, and are the only ornamental decoration. A small trident/psi has also been carved into the foot, apparently in modern times; the same mark is found on the foot of 1927.148, another amphora donated by Edward Perry Warren.</td>\n",

Inspired by the first-to-second-century CE satirist Juvenal, Couture contrasted the orgy in the foreground with the dignified sculptures in the background as an allegory for the degeneration of his own time. Based on real sculptures of famous Romans, the statues look scornfully down on the proceedings, their heroic nudity contrasting with that of the revelers, which is anything but. Some of the celebrants recline, as was common at Roman dinner parties; others mirror the statues’ poses or offer toasts to them. Symbols of the wine god Bacchus in the scene connect the proceedings to wild Bacchanalia, while the two philosophers at the right convey the disapproval of civilized society.</td>\n",

       "113562  It is an open question whether the sea god depicted should be understood as Nereus, the “Old Man of the Sea”, or Triton, Poseidon’s messenger. In Athenian vase-painting, the iconography of these two figures regularly overlaps and it can be difficult to distinguish them. Broadly speaking, Triton is younger, and characterised by a more wild, animalistic nature by comparison with the old man Nereus who is more civilized, and is often even depicted in an entirely human form. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe most important story involving Nereus was an encounter with Herakles, who was supposed to have wrestled him in order to make him reveal the location of the garden of the Hesperides. This is the account given in literary versions of the myth, but depictions of the struggle in vase-painting often substitute Triton for Nereus. \\r\\n\\r\\nA number of early vases (c. 590-570 B.C.E.) depict Heracles struggling with a fish-tailed Nereus, but by 560 B.C.E. painters begin to depict the subject in two distinct ways, with Heracles fighting either an anthropomorphic Nereus, or, much more commonly, a fish-tailed god who must usually be understood as Triton, and is explicitly identified as such by inscriptions on a handful of slightly later vases (London B223, BAPD 320266; Berlin F1906, BAPD 306469; Cambridge G54, BAPD 12709). \\r\\n\\r\\nParticularly important is London B223 (BAPD 320266) which includes the figure of Nereus watching the fight between Triton and Herakles, with all the figures identified by inscriptions, confirming that the two sea-gods were conceived of as different deities (Paris F298, BAPD 302299 also includes Nereus as a spectator to the fight, identified by an inscription). Nonetheless, the iconography of both figures overlaps substantially, and it is often impossible to say for sure whether a given fish-tailed god is Nereus or Triton. The question of exactly why Triton supplanted Nereus as Herakles’ opponent is difficult to answer and has been attributed by different scholars to historical and political events, to art historical development, and to literary influence. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe figure on this vase has often been identified as Triton because of his half-man, half-fish nature, corresponding to the figure that is depicted fighting Herakles in vases of this period. However, comparison with other depictions of Nereus by the same painter suggest that he is probably better thought of as Nereus.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a particularly close resemblance to a figure who is undeniably Nereus on another vase by the Berlin Painter, the stamnos Munich 8738 (BAPD 201980). The stamnos also features a Nereid, with an almost identical pose to the Nereid on the Harvard vase, running towards him, supporting the notion that the Harvard vase depicts the same sea-god. One important difference, however, is that the Nereus on Munich vessel is depicted with lighter hair painted in dilute slip, suggestive of his old age, while the Harvard figure has his hair rendered in black and there are no obvious indications of his age.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother Berlin Painter vase, the hydria London E162 (BAPD 202006), depicts the fight between Herakles and Nereus, and although Nereus is in human form, he, like the figure on the Harvard vase, wears a long cloak and holds both a scepter and a dolphin. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe way that the figure’s cloak masks the transition from human to animal also resembles the Berlin Painter’s depictions of another ‘civilized’ hybrid creature, the centaur Chiron who, unlike the other wild and savage centaurs, was tutor to a number of heroes (Paris G186, BAPD 201959; Munich 8738, BAPD 201980), another point in favour of its identification with the relatively ‘civilized’ Nereus rather than Triton.\\r\\n\\r\\nSee further: \\r\\n\\r\\nJudith M.

       "113562  On one side: a half-anthropomorphic, half-fish sea-god, Nereus, or perhaps Triton. He faces to the right and carries a scepter in his right hand with his little finger extended, and a dolphin in his left, which he holds by the tail. He has long curly hair tied into a bun and a beard. He wears a wreath in added red on his head, and a cloak (himation) decorated with triple dot motifs over a long-sleeved tunic (chiton). Instead of legs, he has a huge fish tail, which rises out of the bottom of his cloak (which conceals the junction between man and fish) and curves around before it ends in a stylised crescent-shaped tail fin, more like a dolphin’s tail than a fish’s. The tail is slightly tinted with dilute glaze and is decorated with single dots in a grid-like arrangement, with a reserved stripe marked out along its length. There are two pairs of fins coming out of the tail.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other side: presumably a Nereid. The Nereids were the sea-nymph daughters of Nereus, the most famous of whom is Thetis, the mother of Achilles. She walks to the left with a wide step, her arms extended in front of her. Her right hand is higher up and seems to point toward the left. She wears a long-sleeved tunic (chiton). This woman is not specifically identified by an inscription or by any iconographical detail, but we can be reasonably sure from the context – alongside the sea god – that she is a Nereid. \\r\\n\\r\\nStrips of meander pattern act as ground line for the two figures, and are the only ornamental decoration. A small trident/psi has also been carved into the foot, apparently in modern times; the same mark is found on the foot of 1927.148, another amphora donated by Edward Perry Warren.   \n",

       "183885  More savage than war, luxury burdened (Rome)\\r\\nand avenged the conquered world.\\r\\n\\r\\n — Juvenal, Satire 6\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA trope of Roman literature was to lament the decay of moral standards, comparing the noble past with the debauched present, often using the excesses of banqueting to illustrate the point. Inspired by the first-to-second-century CE satirist Juvenal, Couture contrasted the orgy in the foreground with the dignified sculptures in the background as an allegory for the degeneration of his own time. Based on real sculptures of famous Romans, the statues look scornfully down on the proceedings, their heroic nudity contrasting with that of the revelers, which is anything but. Some of the celebrants recline, as was common at Roman dinner parties; others mirror the statues’ poses or offer toasts to them. Symbols of the wine god Bacchus in the scene connect the proceedings to wild Bacchanalia, while the two philosophers at the right convey the disapproval of civilized society.   \n",

       "      <td>It is an open question whether the sea god depicted should be understood as Nereus, the “Old Man of the Sea”, or Triton, Poseidon’s messenger. In Athenian vase-painting, the iconography of these two figures regularly overlaps and it can be difficult to distinguish them. Broadly speaking, Triton is younger, and characterised by a more wild, animalistic nature by comparison with the old man Nereus who is more civilized, and is often even depicted in an entirely human form. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe most important story involving Nereus was an encounter with Herakles, who was supposed to have wrestled him in order to make him reveal the location of the garden of the Hesperides. This is the account given in literary versions of the myth, but depictions of the struggle in vase-painting often substitute Triton for Nereus. \\r\\n\\r\\nA number of early vases (c. 590-570 B.C.E.) depict Heracles struggling with a fish-tailed Nereus, but by 560 B.C.E. painters begin to depict the subject in two distinct ways, with Heracles fighting either an anthropomorphic Nereus, or, much more commonly, a fish-tailed god who must usually be understood as Triton, and is explicitly identified as such by inscriptions on a handful of slightly later vases (London B223, BAPD 320266; Berlin F1906, BAPD 306469; Cambridge G54, BAPD 12709). \\r\\n\\r\\nParticularly important is London B223 (BAPD 320266) which includes the figure of Nereus watching the fight between Triton and Herakles, with all the figures identified by inscriptions, confirming that the two sea-gods were conceived of as different deities (Paris F298, BAPD 302299 also includes Nereus as a spectator to the fight, identified by an inscription). Nonetheless, the iconography of both figures overlaps substantially, and it is often impossible to say for sure whether a given fish-tailed god is Nereus or Triton. The question of exactly why Triton supplanted Nereus as Herakles’ opponent is difficult to answer and has been attributed by different scholars to historical and political events, to art historical development, and to literary influence. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe figure on this vase has often been identified as Triton because of his half-man, half-fish nature, corresponding to the figure that is depicted fighting Herakles in vases of this period. However, comparison with other depictions of Nereus by the same painter suggest that he is probably better thought of as Nereus.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a particularly close resemblance to a figure who is undeniably Nereus on another vase by the Berlin Painter, the stamnos Munich 8738 (BAPD 201980). The stamnos also features a Nereid, with an almost identical pose to the Nereid on the Harvard vase, running towards him, supporting the notion that the Harvard vase depicts the same sea-god. One important difference, however, is that the Nereus on Munich vessel is depicted with lighter hair painted in dilute slip, suggestive of his old age, while the Harvard figure has his hair rendered in black and there are no obvious indications of his age.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother Berlin Painter vase, the hydria London E162 (BAPD 202006), depicts the fight between Herakles and Nereus, and although Nereus is in human form, he, like the figure on the Harvard vase, wears a long cloak and holds both a scepter and a dolphin. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe way that the figure’s cloak masks the transition from human to animal also resembles the Berlin Painter’s depictions of another ‘civilized’ hybrid creature, the centaur Chiron who, unlike the other wild and savage centaurs, was tutor to a number of heroes (Paris G186, BAPD 201959; Munich 8738, BAPD 201980), another point in favour of its identification with the relatively ‘civilized’ Nereus rather than Triton.\\r\\n\\r\\nSee further: \\r\\n\\r\\nJudith M.

       "      <td>On one side: a half-anthropomorphic, half-fish sea-god, Nereus, or perhaps Triton. He faces to the right and carries a scepter in his right hand with his little finger extended, and a dolphin in his left, which he holds by the tail. He has long curly hair tied into a bun and a beard. He wears a wreath in added red on his head, and a cloak (himation) decorated with triple dot motifs over a long-sleeved tunic (chiton). Instead of legs, he has a huge fish tail, which rises out of the bottom of his cloak (which conceals the junction between man and fish) and curves around before it ends in a stylised crescent-shaped tail fin, more like a dolphin’s tail than a fish’s. The tail is slightly tinted with dilute glaze and is decorated with single dots in a grid-like arrangement, with a reserved stripe marked out along its length. There are two pairs of fins coming out of the tail.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other side: presumably a Nereid. The Nereids were the sea-nymph daughters of Nereus, the most famous of whom is Thetis, the mother of Achilles. She walks to the left with a wide step, her arms extended in front of her. Her right hand is higher up and seems to point toward the left. She wears a long-sleeved tunic (chiton). This woman is not specifically identified by an inscription or by any iconographical detail, but we can be reasonably sure from the context – alongside the sea god – that she is a Nereid. \\r\\n\\r\\nStrips of meander pattern act as ground line for the two figures, and are the only ornamental decoration. A small trident/psi has also been carved into the foot, apparently in modern times; the same mark is found on the foot of 1927.148, another amphora donated by Edward Perry Warren.</td>\n",

       "      <td>More savage than war, luxury burdened (Rome)\\r\\nand avenged the conquered world.\\r\\n\\r\\n — Juvenal, Satire 6\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA trope of Roman literature was to lament the decay of moral standards, comparing the noble past with the debauched present, often using the excesses of banqueting to illustrate the point. Inspired by the first-to-second-century CE satirist Juvenal, Couture contrasted the orgy in the foreground with the dignified sculptures in the background as an allegory for the degeneration of his own time. Based on real sculptures of famous Romans, the statues look scornfully down on the proceedings, their heroic nudity contrasting with that of the revelers, which is anything but. Some of the celebrants recline, as was common at Roman dinner parties; others mirror the statues’ poses or offer toasts to them. Symbols of the wine god Bacchus in the scene connect the proceedings to wild Bacchanalia, while the two philosophers at the right convey the disapproval of civilized society.</td>\n",

       "113562  It is an open question whether the sea god depicted should be understood as Nereus, the “Old Man of the Sea”, or Triton, Poseidon’s messenger. In Athenian vase-painting, the iconography of these two figures regularly overlaps and it can be difficult to distinguish them. Broadly speaking, Triton is younger, and characterised by a more wild, animalistic nature by comparison with the old man Nereus who is more civilized, and is often even depicted in an entirely human form. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe most important story involving Nereus was an encounter with Herakles, who was supposed to have wrestled him in order to make him reveal the location of the garden of the Hesperides. This is the account given in literary versions of the myth, but depictions of the struggle in vase-painting often substitute Triton for Nereus. \\r\\n\\r\\nA number of early vases (c. 590-570 B.C.E.) depict Heracles struggling with a fish-tailed Nereus, but by 560 B.C.E. painters begin to depict the subject in two distinct ways, with Heracles fighting either an anthropomorphic Nereus, or, much more commonly, a fish-tailed god who must usually be understood as Triton, and is explicitly identified as such by inscriptions on a handful of slightly later vases (London B223, BAPD 320266; Berlin F1906, BAPD 306469; Cambridge G54, BAPD 12709). \\r\\n\\r\\nParticularly important is London B223 (BAPD 320266) which includes the figure of Nereus watching the fight between Triton and Herakles, with all the figures identified by inscriptions, confirming that the two sea-gods were conceived of as different deities (Paris F298, BAPD 302299 also includes Nereus as a spectator to the fight, identified by an inscription). Nonetheless, the iconography of both figures overlaps substantially, and it is often impossible to say for sure whether a given fish-tailed god is Nereus or Triton. The question of exactly why Triton supplanted Nereus as Herakles’ opponent is difficult to answer and has been attributed by different scholars to historical and political events, to art historical development, and to literary influence. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe figure on this vase has often been identified as Triton because of his half-man, half-fish nature, corresponding to the figure that is depicted fighting Herakles in vases of this period. However, comparison with other depictions of Nereus by the same painter suggest that he is probably better thought of as Nereus.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a particularly close resemblance to a figure who is undeniably Nereus on another vase by the Berlin Painter, the stamnos Munich 8738 (BAPD 201980). The stamnos also features a Nereid, with an almost identical pose to the Nereid on the Harvard vase, running towards him, supporting the notion that the Harvard vase depicts the same sea-god. One important difference, however, is that the Nereus on Munich vessel is depicted with lighter hair painted in dilute slip, suggestive of his old age, while the Harvard figure has his hair rendered in black and there are no obvious indications of his age.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother Berlin Painter vase, the hydria London E162 (BAPD 202006), depicts the fight between Herakles and Nereus, and although Nereus is in human form, he, like the figure on the Harvard vase, wears a long cloak and holds both a scepter and a dolphin. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe way that the figure’s cloak masks the transition from human to animal also resembles the Berlin Painter’s depictions of another ‘civilized’ hybrid creature, the centaur Chiron who, unlike the other wild and savage centaurs, was tutor to a number of heroes (Paris G186, BAPD 201959; Munich 8738, BAPD 201980), another point in favour of its identification with the relatively ‘civilized’ Nereus rather than Triton.\\r\\n\\r\\nSee further: \\r\\n\\r\\nJudith M.

       "113562  On one side: a half-anthropomorphic, half-fish sea-god, Nereus, or perhaps Triton. He faces to the right and carries a scepter in his right hand with his little finger extended, and a dolphin in his left, which he holds by the tail. He has long curly hair tied into a bun and a beard. He wears a wreath in added red on his head, and a cloak (himation) decorated with triple dot motifs over a long-sleeved tunic (chiton). Instead of legs, he has a huge fish tail, which rises out of the bottom of his cloak (which conceals the junction between man and fish) and curves around before it ends in a stylised crescent-shaped tail fin, more like a dolphin’s tail than a fish’s. The tail is slightly tinted with dilute glaze and is decorated with single dots in a grid-like arrangement, with a reserved stripe marked out along its length. There are two pairs of fins coming out of the tail.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other side: presumably a Nereid. The Nereids were the sea-nymph daughters of Nereus, the most famous of whom is Thetis, the mother of Achilles. She walks to the left with a wide step, her arms extended in front of her. Her right hand is higher up and seems to point toward the left. She wears a long-sleeved tunic (chiton). This woman is not specifically identified by an inscription or by any iconographical detail, but we can be reasonably sure from the context – alongside the sea god – that she is a Nereid. \\r\\n\\r\\nStrips of meander pattern act as ground line for the two figures, and are the only ornamental decoration. A small trident/psi has also been carved into the foot, apparently in modern times; the same mark is found on the foot of 1927.148, another amphora donated by Edward Perry Warren.   \n",

       "183885  More savage than war, luxury burdened (Rome)\\r\\nand avenged the conquered world.\\r\\n\\r\\n — Juvenal, Satire 6\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA trope of Roman literature was to lament the decay of moral standards, comparing the noble past with the debauched present, often using the excesses of banqueting to illustrate the point. Inspired by the first-to-second-century CE satirist Juvenal, Couture contrasted the orgy in the foreground with the dignified sculptures in the background as an allegory for the degeneration of his own time. Based on real sculptures of famous Romans, the statues look scornfully down on the proceedings, their heroic nudity contrasting with that of the revelers, which is anything but. Some of the celebrants recline, as was common at Roman dinner parties; others mirror the statues’ poses or offer toasts to them. Symbols of the wine god Bacchus in the scene connect the proceedings to wild Bacchanalia, while the two philosophers at the right convey the disapproval of civilized society.   \n",

The lower half of its body is dark gray which fades to a white abdomen. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere are inscriptions in pen and pencil in the right third of the composition, behind the fish.  These inscriptions are oriented vertically, like the album itself. An inscription identifies the fish as “Putka”. Another inscription states, what appears to be “Tetradon”.

The fish has two round eyes and a curved, triangular snout.  It has a continuous row of lateral fins that extend the entire length of the body and taper into the tail.  It is light brown in color with some mottling. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe page has inscriptions in ink and pencil the lower third of the composition.

This painting is part of a four-folio scene, which, combined, would create a large battle painting. It is possible that this folio, along with the other three, was made sometime after the Dispersed Bhagavata Purana series was completed to accompany the series. There is no text on the reverse of this folio. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis painting belongs to the 'Dispersed' Bhagavata Purana series, produced in the early 16th century, possibly in Mathura. The series, possibly consisting of 360 such folios, is based on the tenth book of the Bhagavata Purana, which describes the story of Krishna, particularly his childhood and youth. This series was one of South Asia's earliest illustrated Bhagavata Purana manuscripts. Other folios from the same Bhagavata Purana series in the Harvard Art Museum’s collection are objects 1963.145, 1974.124, 1974.125, 1974.126, 1974.127, 1992.283, 1995.67, 1995.68.

Instead of the characteristic row of tall flowering plants, there is a repeat pattern of staggered rows of a highly stylised floral sprig, with a short stem, a leaf and a flower head. The patka falls into the category of textile art.   \n",
       "151  Two small puffer fish are facing each other halfway down the page, just right of the center. The fish on the left is shown in profile, with a green body that is darker at the top and then fades to a cream-colored abdomen. The fish on the right is depicted from both a profile and top view. This distinct perspective simultaneously highlights the fish's eyes, the demarcations on its back, and its flared abdomen.  The fish is gray with light and dark blue stripes on its back. The lower half of its body is dark gray which fades to a white abdomen. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere are inscriptions in pen and pencil in the right third of the composition, behind the fish.  These inscriptions are oriented vertically, like the album itself. An inscription identifies the fish as “Putka”. Another inscription states, what appears to be “Tetradon”. This could be referring to the family, Tetradontidae. It is possible that the fish represent the species Arothron reticularis from this family, a reticulated puffer fish that is found on the east coast of India.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis work falls into the genre of natural history documentation, an important enterprise undertaken by many European patrons during their time in India.

It is light brown in color with some mottling. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe page has inscriptions in ink and pencil the lower third of the composition.

The neck is engraved with three bands: at the top, a band of kufic script set against a foliated scroll; a second band consisting of a twined rope motif; and on the ring of the neck, a third band of lozenges alternating with roundels. The body bears a broad band of fine thuluth calligraphy punctuated by three large decorative roundels filled with an arabesque motif. Above and below the calligraphy band are arabesque motifs. On the foot ring is an engraved band consisting of an angular, braided rope motif.  Remnants of silver inlay can be found on the neck ring and body of the vase.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe inscription on this vase reveals that it was made for an amir kabir, or Great Emir, of Sultan Hasan (ruled 1347-51 and 1354-61). Up until 1352 the title of amir kabir was given to all senior Mamluk amirs, or freed slaves who were part of the ruling military elite.  After that time, the term was reserved for the commander in chief of the army.  Since the reigns of Sultan Hasan span this transition, this piece may have been made for the commander in chief but also could have been made for any senior amir.\\r\\n\\r\\nNotes from the Glory and Prosperity exhibition, Feb - June 2002.</td>\n",

       "83823   Vase with tall, round, slightly flared neck; the pear-shaped body stands on a tall footring. The neck is engraved with three bands: at the top, a band of kufic script set against a foliated scroll; a second band consisting of a twined rope motif; and on the ring of the neck, a third band of lozenges alternating with roundels. The body bears a broad band of fine thuluth calligraphy punctuated by three large decorative roundels filled with an arabesque motif. Above and below the calligraphy band are arabesque motifs. On the foot ring is an engraved band consisting of an angular, braided rope motif.  Remnants of silver inlay can be found on the neck ring and body of the vase.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe inscription on this vase reveals that it was made for an amir kabir, or Great Emir, of Sultan Hasan (ruled 1347-51 and 1354-61). Up until 1352 the title of amir kabir was given to all senior Mamluk amirs, or freed slaves who were part of the ruling military elite.  After that time, the term was reserved for the commander in chief of the army.  Since the reigns of Sultan Hasan span this transition, this piece may have been made for the commander in chief but also could have been made for any senior amir.\\r\\n\\r\\nNotes from the Glory and Prosperity exhibition, Feb - June 2002.   \n",

The earthenware ceramics on display here date to the Western Han period (when the capital was located in modern-day Xi’an, Shaanxi province) and imitated ritual vessels with painted-lacquer decoration. Fired at relatively low temperatures, earthenware vessels are not fully vitrified and are slightly porous, making them less than ideal as containers for daily use, but suitable as burial items. Few colored compounds can withstand kiln temperatures without alteration; in order to replicate the multiple bright colors and dynamic designs of painted lacquers, mineral pigments were applied to earthenware vessels after firing and are hence “cold-painted.”</td>\n",

       "26  Buddhist reliquary consisting of three parts: pedestal stand, jar, and lid. The lower portion of the stand is bell-shaped, with sides flaring outward toward the flat base and constricting inward at top; a bowl-like receptacle with edges in the form of lotus petals crowns the top of the hollow stand; molded floral appliques and traces of floral designs painted in black pigment encircle the pedestal base; heads of makara creatures bearing pearls in their mouths encircle the join between pedestal and receptacle. The ovoid jar has broad, rounded shoulders, sides tapering inward to a flat base, short neck, and flat, everted rim; two incised horizontal lines encircle the jar along the shoulders and form a band that encloses four molded lion-head appliques. The circular lid is steeply domed and bears a stupa-form finial.

       "34  Bronze and lacquer ritual vessels were expensive commodities that only the privileged class could afford, but in the Han dynasty, ceramic funerary wares that simulated these luxurious vessels became a more affordable means of outfitting one’s tomb, as a finished ceramic piece required far less fuel and specialized labor than a bronze or lacquer. The earthenware ceramics on display here date to the Western Han period (when the capital was located in modern-day Xi’an, Shaanxi province) and imitated ritual vessels with painted-lacquer decoration. Fired at relatively low temperatures, earthenware vessels are not fully vitrified and are slightly porous, making them less than ideal as containers for daily use, but suitable as burial items. Few colored compounds can withstand kiln temperatures without alteration; in order to replicate the multiple bright colors and dynamic designs of painted lacquers, mineral pigments were applied to earthenware vessels after firing and are hence “cold-painted.”   \n",

Sackler Museum, Ernest B. and Helen Pratt Dane Fund for the Acquisition of Oriental Art, 1990.1\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early centuries of the medieval period, Kashmir was a flourishing center of Hindu and Buddhist practices where several cults developed, including localized forms of Shaivism, the worship of the Hindu god Shiva. This work depicts a common icon in the Kashmiri Shaivite tradition, a three-headed form of Shiva known as Maheshvara (great lord). His smooth, rounded form, squat proportions, and flattened features closely resemble the artistic style that developed just before and during the rule of the Kashmiri king Avantivarman (r. c. 855–83). Kashmir was at the cross¬roads between India and the provincial Hellenistic region of Gandhara to the north. The suggestion of musculature in Shiva’s torso reveals the lingering influence of Gandharan styles upon Kashmiri art.\\r\\n</td>\n",

The three heads express different aspects of this manifold deity. A smiling female, a benign male, and a violent male perhaps correspond to Shiva’s powers as creator, protector, and destroyer. The now missing arms would have held additional emblems to communicate the god’s cosmic powers.\\r\\nSacred texts describe Shiva’s complex and paradoxical character. Probably developing around 200 BCE, Shaivism, or the worship of Shiva, had become widespread in India by the late sixth century. A multitude of visual forms—abstract and anthropomorphic—arose to represent Shiva’s grace, energy, and mythic exploits. The rounded forms, well-modeled musculature, and controlled exuberance of this figure characterize the sculptural style that developed in late ninth-century Kashmir, during the reign of the Karkota dynasty (625–1003).</td>\n",

This composite or “pastiche” object has been disassembled and the fragments are now accessioned individually, as 1969.177.86.1 (head and torso) and 1969.177.86.2 (legs). The clay fabrics of the two fragments do not match each other: this is clear from X-radiography, which indicated that the materials were different (e.g., different density and inclusions), as well as from visible inspection of the terracotta. Additionally, once the fragments were separated and the modern filling materials were removed, it was apparent that the breaks did not match.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe relationship between the fragments is not clear. Several scenarios are possible: (1) the fragments are from two different ancient figurines (a “pastiche” of ancient fragments); (2) one fragment (such as the legs) was made in the 20th century to complete the other fragment (which in this scenario would, presumably, be ancient); (3) both fragments are modern.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese fragments are fairly typical examples of a category of figurines depicting a nude female figure with a “bird-like” face. These were made in the 2nd millennium BCE at sites across northern Syria (today’s eastern Turkey and northern Syria). Specifically, this figurine is in a form that comes from the region of the Orontes River. Such figurines are often interpreted as goddesses or divinities; the frequent depiction of breasts (not present here) and pubic triangles (present here) have encouraged interpretations of deities or domains of life pertaining to female sexuality and/or fertility. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt is common for figurines of this type to be broken across the legs. It is not currently clear if this frequent breakage pattern is the result of intentional, perhaps ritual, breakage or merely indicates a common susceptibility of the figurines to breakage during use or deposition.\\r\\n\\r\\nFurther information on this type of figurine may be found in the following standard reference work (where falls into the category of Orontes Type MAI 2): Leila Badre. 1980.

Examples like numbers 1–4 [1998.15.16; 1992.256.12.1–3; 2022.242.1–3; 1969.177.86.1–2] have been found across today’s northern Syria and southeastern Türkiye (Turkey) in sanctuaries and graves dating from the second millennium BCE. Their applied breasts and incised pubic triangles mark them as female, encouraging modern interpretations about fertility and sexuality. Number 5 [1953.118], likely made on the island of Cyprus, shows similar features, attesting to ideas about female bodies shared between distant but connected communities of the eastern Mediterranean and western Asia during the Bronze Age. \\r\\nWho exactly do they depict? Goddesses or worshippers? Both or neither? Any answers are complicated by wrinkles in their modern stories that raise a more urgent question: are these objects even ancient? \\r\\nAll six figurines moved through the art market without documented findspots, making it difficult to interpret them or even assess their authenticity. Number 6 [1999.252] may be a modern forgery. And while numbers 2–4 [1992.256.12.1–3; 2022.242.1–3; 1969.177.86.1–2] arrived at Harvard as single objects, each, in fact, comprises several pieces that are not original to each other.

Each strand of the braid is composed of three different colors (either red, light buff, and dark buff or light yellow, dark yellow, and dark buff), the lightest of which is always in the middle—creating an effect of shading and variety.

These were made in the 2nd millennium BCE at sites across northern Syria (today’s eastern Turkey and northern Syria). Specifically, this figurine takes a form that comes from the region of the Orontes River. Such figurines are often interpreted as goddesses or divinities; the frequent depiction of breasts (not present here) and pubic triangles (present here) have encouraged interpretations of deities or domains of life pertaining to female sexuality and/or fertility. It is common for figurines of this type to be broken across the legs. It is not currently clear if this frequent breakage pattern is the result of intentional, perhaps ritual, breakage or merely indicates a common susceptibility of the figurines to breakage during use or deposition.\\r\\n\\r\\nFurther information on this type of figurine may be found in the following standard reference work (where it falls into the category of Orontes Type MAI 2): Leila Badre. 1980.

       "      <td>Of Fragments and Forgeries \\r\\nThese figurines—with their curious faces (sometimes deemed “bird-like”), elaborate headdresses, and emphatic hips—are puzzling. Examples like numbers 1–4 [1998.15.16; 1992.256.12.1–3; 2022.242.1–3; 1969.177.86.1–2] have been found across today’s northern Syria and southeastern Türkiye (Turkey) in sanctuaries and graves dating from the second millennium BCE. Their applied breasts and incised pubic triangles mark them as female, encouraging modern interpretations about fertility and sexuality. Number 5 [1953.118], likely made on the island of Cyprus, shows similar features, attesting to ideas about female bodies shared between distant but connected communities of the eastern Mediterranean and western Asia during the Bronze Age. \\r\\nWho exactly do they depict? Goddesses or worshippers? Both or neither? Any answers are complicated by wrinkles in their modern stories that raise a more urgent question: are these objects even ancient? \\r\\nAll six figurines moved through the art market without documented findspots, making it difficult to interpret them or even assess their authenticity. Number 6 [1999.252] may be a modern forgery. And while numbers 2–4 [1992.256.12.1–3; 2022.242.1–3; 1969.177.86.1–2] arrived at Harvard as single objects, each, in fact, comprises several pieces that are not original to each other. It is not clear whether the fragments are all ancient, all modern, or a combination of both. Displayed here disassembled, the objects offer a cautionary tale about the uncertainty that accompanies poorly documented paths on the art market.</td>\n",

       "      <td>This chalcedony cylinder seal features an image of a lion chasing a stag. Both animals are in mid-leap, with their legs extended almost horizontally. The lion has large paws and a long tail that flies out behind it. Its face and mane are rendered in minute detail, with the nose, eye, ear, and individual tufts of fur all shown. The musculature of the lion’s body is modeled, especially at the shoulder. The stag’s body is more flat, though it is rounded at the shoulder. Its eye, ear, and a four-point antler are all shown. There is no groundline in the scene. A large chip is missing from beneath the stag.\\r\\n\\r\\nLion attacks occur on Persian and Greek seals of the sixth through fourth centuries BCE. It is difficult to identify where this seal was made, since the modeled carving style is not specific to a certain region. However, cylinder seals were in wide use in the Achaemenid Persian Empire. Furthermore, the impression of a seal on a cuneiform tablet excavated at Persepolis features a comparable scene of lions attacking a stag (1); the carving style and details of this seal are similar to those that appear on the Harvard seal.\\r\\n\\r\\nNOTE\\r\\n\\r\\n1.

She dances atop a small table, stretching her arms out in front of her as she kicks her legs into the air. Her short, knee-length tunic is of an oriental style, coming from the eastern regions of the Mediterranean, white with black speckles, and she wears a matching headdress. She is accompanied by a pipe-player who stands in front of her wearing a long tunic and her hair tied back donning an ivy wreath. Behind her stands the nude figure of Silenos (elderly companion of Dionysos) with one hand on his hip and the other holding a thyrsus (ivy-topped staff). Mirroring him on the other side of the dancer is another companion of Dionysos: a maenad. She faces the dancer wearing a long tunic fastened at the waist and has a fine headdress and earrings. She also holds a thyrsus while her other hand rests on her hip. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn the opposite side of the vase, in far cruder rendering, are two draped youths facing each other in conversation. The youth on the left holds an oil flask and a strigil, two items associated with athletic activities in the gymnasium.

Sackler Museum, Ernest B. and Helen Pratt Dane Fund for the Acquisition of Oriental Art, 1990.1\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early centuries of the medieval period, Kashmir was a flourishing center of Hindu and Buddhist practices where several cults developed, including localized forms of Shaivism, the worship of the Hindu god Shiva. This work depicts a common icon in the Kashmiri Shaivite tradition, a three-headed form of Shiva known as Maheshvara (great lord). His smooth, rounded form, squat proportions, and flattened features closely resemble the artistic style that developed just before and during the rule of the Kashmiri king Avantivarman (r. c. 855–83). Kashmir was at the cross¬roads between India and the provincial Hellenistic region of Gandhara to the north. The suggestion of musculature in Shiva’s torso reveals the lingering influence of Gandharan styles upon Kashmiri art.\\r\\n   \n",

However, these two fragments were not original to each other. This composite or “pastiche” object has been disassembled and the fragments are now accessioned individually, as 1969.177.86.1 (head and torso) and 1969.177.86.2 (legs). The clay fabrics of the two fragments do not match each other: this is clear from X-radiography, which indicated that the materials were different (e.g., different density and inclusions), as well as from visible inspection of the terracotta. Additionally, once the fragments were separated and the modern filling materials were removed, it was apparent that the breaks did not match.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe relationship between the fragments is not clear. Several scenarios are possible: (1) the fragments are from two different ancient figurines (a “pastiche” of ancient fragments); (2) one fragment (such as the legs) was made in the 20th century to complete the other fragment (which in this scenario would, presumably, be ancient); (3) both fragments are modern.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese fragments are fairly typical examples of a category of figurines depicting a nude female figure with a “bird-like” face. These were made in the 2nd millennium BCE at sites across northern Syria (today’s eastern Turkey and northern Syria). Specifically, this figurine is in a form that comes from the region of the Orontes River. Such figurines are often interpreted as goddesses or divinities; the frequent depiction of breasts (not present here) and pubic triangles (present here) have encouraged interpretations of deities or domains of life pertaining to female sexuality and/or fertility. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt is common for figurines of this type to be broken across the legs. It is not currently clear if this frequent breakage pattern is the result of intentional, perhaps ritual, breakage or merely indicates a common susceptibility of the figurines to breakage during use or deposition.\\r\\n\\r\\nFurther information on this type of figurine may be found in the following standard reference work (where falls into the category of Orontes Type MAI 2): Leila Badre. 1980.

       "33  This terracotta figurine arrived at the museum as one object, comprising three fragments that had been mended together.

It possibly represented a decorated column, which were common devices for dividing up scenes and motifs and evoking architecture on large-scale wall hangings. These columns were elaborately and colorfully decorated, with braid motifs especially favored.\\r\\nThis fragment’s design consists of a simple double-filleted border (green and buff) on either side of a four-strand braid against a dark background. Buff dots fill the interstices in the braid. Each strand of the braid is composed of three different colors (either red, light buff, and dark buff or light yellow, dark yellow, and dark buff), the lightest of which is always in the middle—creating an effect of shading and variety. Each strand has a dark outline that blends into the braid’s background.\\r\\nThe linen warps run perpendicularly to the length of the braid design, further supporting the suggestion that this piece belonged to a long curtain.\\r\\nA strip of plain-woven linen survives on one side of the tapestry band.   \n",

Both animals are in mid-leap, with their legs extended almost horizontally. The lion has large paws and a long tail that flies out behind it. Its face and mane are rendered in minute detail, with the nose, eye, ear, and individual tufts of fur all shown. The musculature of the lion’s body is modeled, especially at the shoulder. The stag’s body is more flat, though it is rounded at the shoulder. Its eye, ear, and a four-point antler are all shown. There is no groundline in the scene. A large chip is missing from beneath the stag.\\r\\n\\r\\nLion attacks occur on Persian and Greek seals of the sixth through fourth centuries BCE. It is difficult to identify where this seal was made, since the modeled carving style is not specific to a certain region. However, cylinder seals were in wide use in the Achaemenid Persian Empire. Furthermore, the impression of a seal on a cuneiform tablet excavated at Persepolis features a comparable scene of lions attacking a stag (1); the carving style and details of this seal are similar to those that appear on the Harvard seal.\\r\\n\\r\\nNOTE\\r\\n\\r\\n1.

       "36  This vase features a lively party scene, focusing on a central dancer who is highlighted by white skin and clothing. She dances atop a small table, stretching her arms out in front of her as she kicks her legs into the air. Her short, knee-length tunic is of an oriental style, coming from the eastern regions of the Mediterranean, white with black speckles, and she wears a matching headdress. She is accompanied by a pipe-player who stands in front of her wearing a long tunic and her hair tied back donning an ivy wreath. Behind her stands the nude figure of Silenos (elderly companion of Dionysos) with one hand on his hip and the other holding a thyrsus (ivy-topped staff). Mirroring him on the other side of the dancer is another companion of Dionysos: a maenad. She faces the dancer wearing a long tunic fastened at the waist and has a fine headdress and earrings. She also holds a thyrsus while her other hand rests on her hip. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn the opposite side of the vase, in far cruder rendering, are two draped youths facing each other in conversation.

The three heads express different aspects of this manifold deity. A smiling female, a benign male, and a violent male perhaps correspond to Shiva’s powers as creator, protector, and destroyer. The now missing arms would have held additional emblems to communicate the god’s cosmic powers.\\r\\nSacred texts describe Shiva’s complex and paradoxical character. Probably developing around 200 BCE, Shaivism, or the worship of Shiva, had become widespread in India by the late sixth century. A multitude of visual forms—abstract and anthropomorphic—arose to represent Shiva’s grace, energy, and mythic exploits. The rounded forms, well-modeled musculature, and controlled exuberance of this figure characterize the sculptural style that developed in late ninth-century Kashmir, during the reign of the Karkota dynasty (625–1003).   \n",
